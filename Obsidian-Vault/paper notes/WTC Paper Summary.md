the cognitive decline in AD occurs continuously over a long period


## Alzheimer disease 
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/Dementia%20and%20air%20pollution/Alzheimer%20disease.pdf)

Alzheimer disease (AD) is biologically defined by the presence of ==β - amyloid- ==containing ==plaques== and ==tau-== containing neurofibrillary ==tangles==. AD is a genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disease that causes an amnestic cognitive impairment in its prototypical presentation and non- amnestic cognitive impairment in its less common variants. AD is a common cause of cognitive impairment acquired in midlife and late- life but its clinical impact is modified by other neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. This Primer conceives of AD biology as the brain disorder that results from a complex interplay of loss of synaptic homeostasis and dysfunction in the highly interrelated endosomal/lysosomal clearance pathways in which the precursors, aggregated species and post- translationally modified products of Aβ and tau play important roles. Therapeutic endeavours are still struggling to find targets within this framework that substantially change the clinical course in persons with AD. 阿尔茨海默病(AD)在生物学上定义为含有β-淀粉样蛋白的斑块和含有tau的神经原纤维缠结。 AD是一种遗传性和散发性神经退行性疾病，其典型表现为遗忘性认知障碍，其较少见的变异为非遗忘性认知障碍。 AD是中年和晚期认知障碍的常见原因，但它的临床影响被其他神经退行性疾病和脑血管疾病所改变。 本引物认为AD生物学是由于**突触稳态丧失**和高度相关的**内体/溶酶体清除途径功能障碍**的复杂相互作用而导致的脑疾病，其中*Aβ和tau的前体、聚集物种和翻译后修饰产物发挥了重要作用*。 治疗努力仍在努力寻找在这个框架内实质性地改变AD患者临床病程的靶点。

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by β - amyloid (Aβ )- containing extra­ cellular plaques and tau- containing intracellular neuro­ fibrillary tangles. AD typically presents with prominent amnestic cognitive impairment but can **also** less commonly manifest as non- amnestic cognitive impairment. The presentation of AD with short- term memory difficulty is most common but impairment in expressive speech, visuospatial processing and executive (mental agility) functions also occurs. Most cases of AD are not dominantly inherited and there is a complex relationship to genetics in many persons with AD. 阿尔茨海默病（Alzheimer disease，AD)是一种以含有β-淀粉样蛋白(Aβ)的胞外斑块和含有tau的胞内神经纤维缠结为特征的神经退行性疾病。 AD通常表现为明显的遗忘性认知障碍，但也可不常见地表现为非遗忘性认知障碍。 以==短时记忆困难为表现的AD是最常见的，但在表达性言语、视觉空间处理和执行（心理敏捷）功能方面也会发生损害==。 大多数AD病例不是显性遗传，在许多AD患者中与遗传有复杂的关系。 The severity of cognitive impairment in patients with AD varies. The earliest manifestations can be a subjective decline in mental abilities in the absence of impaired performance on objective cognitive testing. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to the earliest symptomatic stage of cognitive impairment in which a single cognitive domain or, possibly, multiple cognitive domains are impaired to at least a mild extent whilst functional capacities are relatively preserved. By contrast, dementia is defined as cognitive impairment of sufficient magnitude to impair independence and affect daily life. Dementia of gradual onset and ongoing progression with prominent amnestic symptoms and signs is the prototypical clinical phenotype of AD ==AD患者认知损害的严重程度各不相同==。 最早的表现可以是在客观认知测试中没有受损的情况下主观智力下降。 轻度认知损害(MCI)是指认知损害的最早症状阶段，其中单个认知领域或可能是多个认知领域至少轻度受损，而功能能力相对保留。 相比之下，痴呆症被定义为足以损害独立性和影响日常生活的认知障碍。 AD的典型临床表型是逐渐起病和持续进展的痴呆，并伴有明显的遗忘症状和体征. AD was originally considered a clinicopathological entity, meaning that, if the patient fulfilled the clinical syndrome of an amnestic dementia and other conditions were ruled out, one could assume that AD pathology was the cause. However, increased clinical sophistication together with biomarkers of AD, namely cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and PET markers for Aβ and tau, has transformed the concept of AD to a neurobiological condition that affects different aspects of cognition. Of note, there is a greater appreciation of the relationship between AD and other aetiologies of cognitive impairment. Although multi- aetiology dementia (which is the preferred term over ‘mixed dementia’) is not the focus of this Primer, it is important to remember that AD pathology rarely occurs in isolation in patients > 65 years of age. AD最初被认为是一个临床病理实体，这意味着，如果患者符合遗忘性痴呆的临床综合征，并排除了其他条件，人们可以假设AD病理是原因。 然而，随着临床的日益成熟，加上AD的生物标志物，即脑脊液(CSF)和Aβ和tau的PET标志物，==已经将AD的概念转变为影响认知不同方面的神经生物学状况==。 值得注意的是，对AD和其他认知障碍病因之间的关系有了更大的认识。 虽然多病因痴呆（相对于“混合性痴呆”的首选术语）不是本入门的重点，但重要的是要记住，AD病理很少单独的发生在65岁以上的患者中。  This Primer reviews the epidemiology of the cognitive manifestations of AD and highlights the main risk factors of this disorder. In addition, this Primer summarizes the pathophysiology of AD from the perspective of a synaptic disorder and reviews advances in its diagnosis, including clinical diagnosis and advances in biomarkers, as well as the management and quality of life of persons living with cognitive impairment due to AD and that of their caregivers. 本入门综述了AD认知表现流行病学，并强调了该疾病的主要危险因素。此外，该引物从突触障碍的角度总结了AD的病理生理学，并回顾了其诊断的进展，包括临床诊断和生物标志物的进展，以及由于AD及其照顾者的认知障碍患者的管理和生活质量。

  
### Epidemiology
#### Incidence and prevalence
The epidemiology of AD is intertwined with that of all- cause dementia (Fig. 1) . Although AD is the most common cause of dementia, dementia can be caused by multiple neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular pathologies, particularly in older patients . Indeed, in one study of 184 individuals who met research neuropathological criteria for AD9, 31% had only AD pathology, 22% had AD pathology plus α - synuclein pathology (Lewy bodies outside of the brainstem), 29.5% had AD pathology plus TDP43 pathology (TDP43 inclusions in hippocampi), and 17.5% had AD pathology plus α - synuclein and TDP43 pathology. Within each of these pathologically defined groups, between 29% and 52% of individuals had at least one infarct (microinfarct, lacunar infarct or large infarct). AD的流行病学与全因痴呆的流行病学交织在一起 (图1)。尽管AD是痴呆的最常见原因，但痴呆可能是由多种神经变性或脑血管疾病引起的，尤其是在老年患者中。事实上，在一项对184名符合AD9研究神经病理学标准的个体的研究中，31% 只有*AD病理学*，22% 有AD病理学加 *α-突触核蛋白病理学 (脑干以外的路易体)*，29.5% 有AD病理学加*TDP43病理学 (海马中TDP43内含物)*，17.5% 有AD病理加 α-突触核蛋白和TDP43病理。在这些病理定义的组中的每一个中，在29% 和52% 之间的个体具有至少一个梗塞 (微梗塞，腔隙性梗塞或大梗塞).The prevalence of all- cause dementia is expected to increase from 50 million people in 2010 to 113 million by 2050 worldwide . Although the prevalence of dementia has increased in both high- income and middle/low- income countries over the past 50 years owing to an extended life expectancy , *the incidence of dementia has slightly decreased in some high- income countries* such as the USA, UK and France11 . For example, in the Framingham Heart Study, the age- adjusted and sex- adjusted hazard rate for incident dementia in persons aged > 60 years was 3.6 per 100 persons in the late 1970s and early 1980s but 2.2 per 100 persons by the late 2000s and early 2010s . The lower incidence of dementia in people born more recently could be *due to the educational, socio- economic, health- care and lifestyle changes* that have occurred in the past several decades. In particular, greater educational attainment is a protective factor against dementia presumably because it conveys a greater capacity to withstand the consequences of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease (referred to as ‘cognitive resilience’ ). However, **attempts at proving cause- and- effect relationships between the various mitigating factors and dementia incidence have proved difficult** . Of note, the reduction in dementia incidence cannot be specifically attributed to AD, although one neuropathological study found a trend for a 24% decline in brain Aβ burden from 1972 to 2006 in a sample of 1,599 individuals with a mean age of 82 ± 8 years . 全因性痴呆的患病率预计将从2010年的5000万人增加到世界2050年的1.13亿人。尽管在过去的50年中，由于预期寿命延长，在高收入和中/低收入国家的痴呆症患病率都有所增加11，但在一些高收入国家，例如美国，英国和法国。例如，在Framingham心脏研究中，到2010年21世纪00年代末和2010年初，年龄>= 60岁的人发生痴呆的年龄调整和性别调整的危险率在20世纪70年代末和20世纪80年代初为每100人3.6，但每100人2.2。最近出生的人痴呆症的发病率较低，可能是由于过去几十年来教育、社会经济、医疗保健和生活方式的变化。特别是，更高的教育程度可能是预防痴呆症的保护因素，因为它传达了更大的能力来承受神经退行性疾病和脑血管疾病的后果 (称为 “认知弹性”)。然而，证明各种缓解因素与痴呆症发病率之间的因果关系的尝试已被证明是困难的。值得注意的是，痴呆症发病率的降低不能特别归因于AD，尽管一项神经病理学研究发现，在1,599名平均年龄为82 ± 8岁的个体样本中，1972年2006年的脑a β 负担有24% 下降的趋势。The prevalence of overt cognitive impairment increases exponentially with advancing age. Indeed, the incidence of dementia increases steeply after 65 years and continues to increase thereafter. The incidence of all- cause dementia in individuals aged 65–70 years is approximately 1 per 100 per year and increases to 4 per 100 per year in those aged 80–90 years16 . In a meta- analysis of 20 studies from Europe and North America, the prevalence of clinically diagnosed amnestic dementia (dementia attributed without biomarkers of AD) increased from < 1% in persons aged 65–69 years to 7–8% in those aged 80–84 years to 27% in those aged 90–94 years17 . In general, the incidence of MCI is about twice that of dementia at any given age18. Studies using MRI and PET to estimate the burden of AD have estimated that MCI with AD pathology contributes to ~50% of all cases of MCI19 and dementia due to AD contributes to ~60–90% of all dementia cases20. Other aetiologies, such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease, may be contributory in up to half of persons with AD21 . The fastest- growing demographic segment in high- income countries is the oldest- old group (people aged > 90 years), which is the group with the highest risk of cognitive disorders, particularly multi- aetiology dementia. Improvement in survival into older adulthood in low- income and middle- income countries11 is driving an increased overall societal burden of dementia. 随着年龄的增长，明显的认知障碍的患病率呈指数增长。事实上，痴呆症的发病率在65年后急剧增加，此后继续增加。在65-70岁的个体中，全因性痴呆的发病率约为每年1 100，而在80-90岁的个体中，则增加到每年4 100 。在对来自欧洲和北美的20项研究的荟萃分析中，临床诊断为遗忘性痴呆 (无AD生物标志物的痴呆) 的患病率从65-69岁人群的 <1% 增加到80-84岁人群的7-8%，到90-94岁人群的27% 。一般而言，在任何特定年龄，MCI的发病率约为痴呆症的两倍。使用MRI和PET评估AD负担的研究估计，*患有AD病理的MCI导致了所有MCI病例的约50%，而AD引起的痴呆导致了所有痴呆病例的约60-90%*。其他病因，例如脑血管疾病和路易体病，可能会导致多达一半的AD患者。在高收入国家中增长最快的人口群体是年龄最大的人群 (年龄> 90岁的人)，这是认知障碍，特别是多病因痴呆风险最高的人群。在低收入和中等收入国家中，老年人成年后生存率的提高正在推动痴呆症的整体社会负担增加。The prevalence and incidence of dementia have been well studied in high- income countries but are less well understood in low- income and middle- income countries. Provisional estimates support the view that dementia is a worldwide illness with little variation in age- specific prevalence between regions . The prevalence of subjective cognitive complaints was 25% worldwide in one meta- analysis of 16 studies, although individual estimates varied from 6% to 53%23 , implying diversity in how subjective cognitive decline is defined both within and across different regions and cultures. Similar to dementia, the prevalence of MCI varies by age — the reported prevalence was 6.7% in individuals aged 60–64 years and 25.2% in those aged 80–84 years in a meta- analysis of 34 studies from high- income countries24 . 在高收入国家已经对痴呆症的患病率和发病率进行了很好的研究，但在低收入和中等收入国家却不太了解。临时估计支持这样的观点，即痴呆症是一种全球性疾病，地区之间的特定年龄患病率差异很小。在一项16项研究的荟萃分析中，主观认知抱怨的患病率在全球范围内25%，尽管个人估计值从6% 到53% 不等，这意味着在不同地区和文化之间以及不同地区和文化之间主观认知下降的定义方式存在多样性。与痴呆症相似，MCI的患病率因年龄而异-在对来自高收入国家的34项研究进行的荟萃分析中，报告的患病率在60-64岁的个体中6.7%，在80-84岁的个体中25.2% 。

  
#### Risk Factors
Age is the most important risk factor for both dementia and AD. In the aged population worldwide, for example, in those aged > 65 years, more women than men have dementia owing to an excess all- cause mortality in men aged > 45 years . In addition, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment may be higher in men; one study found an OR of 1.54 (95% CI 1.2–2.0) for MCI in men versus women in a community comprised of European- Americans . However, in many studies, the prevalence of dementia is either higher in women or finds no difference between sexes . *年龄是痴呆和AD最重要的危险因素*。例如，在世界范围内的老年人口中，年龄大于65岁的老年人口中，由于年龄大于45岁的男性的全因死亡率过高，因此患有痴呆症的女性多于男性。此外，男性轻度认知障碍的患病率可能更高; 一项研究发现，在由欧美国家组成的社区中，男性与女性的MCI 1.54 OR (95% CI 1.2-2.0) 。然而，在许多研究中，女性痴呆症的患病率更高，或者发现性别之间没有差异。Genetic risk factors for AD include rare dominantly inherited mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 and in more common but incompletely penetrant genetic variations such as APOE. Taken together, genetic contributions represent only a modest part of the attributable risk as manifested in the age of onset .  AD的遗传危险因素包括APP，PSEN1和PSEN2中罕见的显性遗传突变，以及更常见但不完全渗透的遗传变异，例如APOE。总之，遗传贡献仅占发病年龄中归因于风险的一小部分。Dominantly ==inherited AD has an age of onset that is ~40 years earlier than sporadic late- onset AD==   but otherwise *shares many clinical, biomarker and pathological similarities*. Mutations in APP (encoding **amyloid precursor protein (APP**)), PSEN1 (encoding **presenilin 1**) and PSEN2 (encoding presenilin 2) account for almost all cases of dominantly inherited AD . Persons with mutations in these genes are almost always younger than 65 years when they develop symptoms and represent only a minority of persons with AD dementia in this age group, in which AD and frontotemporal degenerations are about equally common. A rare variant of APP (A673T) that is protective against Aβ production and clinical symptomatology has been identified .  显性遗传性AD的发病年龄比散发性迟发性AD早40年，但在其他方面具有许多临床，生物标志物和病理相似性。APP (编码淀粉样蛋白前体蛋白 (APP))，PSEN1 (编码早老素1) 和PSEN2 (编码早老素2) 的突变几乎占主要遗传性AD的所有病例。这些基因突变的人在出现症状时几乎总是小于65岁，并且在该年龄段中仅占AD痴呆患者的少数，其中AD和额颞退化几乎同样普遍。已鉴定出一种罕见的APP (A673T) 变体，可防止A β 产生和临床症状。More than 600 genes have been investigated as susceptibility factors for AD. APOE is a susceptibility polymorphism and is the most important genetic risk factor for AD occurring after 65 years. *Carriage of the APOE ε 4 allele* increases the risk for dementia by *3–4 times*  in **heterozygotes** and by *12–15 times* in **homozygotes** compared with APOE ε 3 carriers . Some susceptibility genes, such as TREM2, SORL1 and ABCA7, if combined, may be useful in polygenic risk scores, even accounting for the presence of the APOE ε 4 genotype, for predicting incident dementia due to AD . The rare genetic variants convey a lower risk of AD than the APOE ε 4 allele; indeed, the rare R47H variant of TREM2 conveys a tenth of the risk of heterozygosity of APOE ε 4 and all of the other identified risk genes are 100- fold less potent than APOE ε 4  . Mutations in MAPT (encoding tau) are not associated with AD, although variants of tau- binding proteins such as BIN1, CD2AP, FERMT2, CASS4 and PTK2B are risk genes in large- scale analyses . The genetics of rare variants has played and will continue to play a critical role in suggesting important disease mechanisms in AD.  已经研究了600多个基因作为AD的易感因素。APOE是一种易感性多态性，是65年后发生AD的最重要的遗传危险因素。与apoeε3携带者相比，携带apoeε4等位基因在杂合子中增加了3-4倍的痴呆风险，在纯合子中增加了12-15倍。一些易感基因，例如TREM2，SORL1和ABCA7，如果结合在一起，可能对多基因风险评分有用，甚至可以解释apoeε4基因型的存在，以预测AD引起的痴呆事件。罕见的遗传变异比apoeε4等位基因传递更低的AD风险; 实际上，TREM2的罕见R47H变体传递apoeε4杂合性风险的十分之一，并且所有其他已识别的风险基因的效力比apoeε4低100倍。MAPT (编码tau) 的突变与AD无关，尽管tau结合蛋白的变体如BIN1，CD2AP，FERMT2，CASS4和PTK2B是大规模分析中的风险基因。罕见变体的遗传学已经并将继续在提示AD的重要疾病机制中发挥关键作用。Several potentially modifiable risk factors occurring in midlife, in particular metabolic factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and low HDL cholesterol), hearing loss, traumatic brain injury and alcohol abuse, are associated with an increased risk of later- life dementia, with relative risks of between 1.5 and 1.8  . In later life, smoking, depression, low physical activity, social isolation, diabetes mellitus and air pollution are risk factors of similar magnitude for dementia, although several of these, such as low physical activity, social isolation and depression, may have a bi- directional link and may be part of the prodromal phase of dementia . Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are probably the most common and important risk factors for late- life dementia, especially when those risk factors are present in midlife but in late life as well . Although there is some evidence for an influence of midlife vascular risk factors on later- life brain Aβ , both diabetes mellitus and hypertension induce cerebrovascular disease and are thought to affect the clinical expression of AD pathology  through the modifying effects of atherosclerotic and arteriolosclerotic cerebrovascular disease rather than through a direct effect on Aβ or tau biology .  中年发生的几种潜在可改变的危险因素，特别是代谢因素 (糖尿病，高血压，肥胖和低HDL胆固醇)，听力损失，创伤性脑损伤和酗酒，与晚年痴呆的风险增加有关，相对风险在1.5至1.8之间。在以后的生活中，**吸烟，抑郁，低体力活动，社会隔离，糖尿病和空气污染**是痴呆的危险因素，尽管其中一些，例如低体力活动，社会隔离和抑郁，可能具有双向联系，并且可能是痴呆症前驱期的一部分。糖尿病和高血压可能是晚期痴呆的最常见和最重要的危险因素，尤其是当这些危险因素存在于中年但晚期时。尽管有一些证据表明中年血管危险因素对晚年脑a β 的影响，糖尿病和高血压均诱发脑血管疾病，并被认为通过动脉粥样硬化和动脉硬化性脑血管疾病的改变作用而不是通过对a β 或tau生物学的直接影响来影响AD病理的临床表达。

### Mechanisms/Pathophysiology

AD is a synaptic dysfunction disorder encompassing molecular, cellular and macro- scale cortical circuitry system failures that has a predilection for a cognitively eloquent cortex. Synaptic pathophysiology is an attractive theme in unifying observations about genetics, cell biology, neuropathology and the clinical manifestations of AD. The **pathology of AD can be viewed as positive (‘overt’) lesions** that can be observed using microscopy, that is, tau- containing neurofibrillary tangles, Aβ - containing plaques, activated glia or enlarged endosomes. Alternatively, ==AD can be viewed as representing negative (‘covert’) phenomena==, that is, the loss of synaptic homeostasis, neurons or neuronal network integrity. While the biology of amyloid precursor protein and tau protein is featured prominently throughout this Primer, the apparent primacy of these proteins as embodied in the *amyloid cascade hypothesis fails to acknowledge the many other covert mechanisms*, not all of which can be covered here , that have been hypothesized as relevant. Understanding how the mechanisms that underlie AD lead to synaptic and neuronal loss, which are the likely causes of cognitive impairment, has been a matter of substantial investigation yet much remains to be learned. AD是一种突触功能障碍性疾病，包括分子，细胞和宏观尺度的皮质电路系统故障，其倾向于认知雄辩的皮质。突触病理生理学是统一对遗传学，细胞生物学，神经病理学和AD临床表现的观察的一个有吸引力的主题。AD的病理可以看作是阳性 (“过度”) 病变，可以使用显微镜观察到，即含tau的神经原纤维缠结，含a β 的斑块，活化的神经胶质或扩大的内体。或者，AD可以被视为代表负面 (“覆盖”) 现象，即突触稳态，神经元或神经元网络完整性的丧失。虽然淀粉样蛋白前体蛋白和tau蛋白的生物学特征在整个文章中都很突出，但淀粉样蛋白级联假说中体现的这些蛋白的明显首要性未能承认许多其他隐蔽机制，但并非所有这些机制都可以在这里涵盖，已被假设为相关。了解AD的基础机制如何导致突触和神经元丢失，这是认知障碍的可能原因，一直是一个实质性研究的问题，但仍有许多有待学习。

#### The critical molecules
The pathology of canonical AD dementia involves Aβ - containing extracellular neuritic plaques that are found in a widespread distribution throughout the cerebral cortex and tau- containing neurofibrillary tangles that occur initially in the medial temporal lobe, followed by the isocortical regions of the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes  典型的AD痴呆的病理涉及含a β 的细胞外神经斑块，这些斑块在整个大脑皮层和含tau的神经原纤维缠结中广泛分布，最初发生在内侧颞叶，然后是颞叶的等皮质区域，顶叶和额叶. Aβ peptides are derived from APP (a single transmembrane protein that is enriched in neuronal synapses ) following the cleavage of APP by β - secretases and γ - secretases (known as the amyloidogenic pathway) (Fig. 2) . The most abundant species of Aβ are 27–43 amino acids in length. After production, Aβ is secreted into the extracellular space as a monomer . Owing to its sequence, Aβ (particularly Aβ 42) has a high propensity to aggregate, which occurs in a concentration- dependent manner. In addition to Aβ , other molecules — APPsβ , β CTF and AICD — are formed in the amyloidogenic pathway. APP cleavage by α - secretase generates APPsα and α CTF and prevents Aβ formation; α CTF is subsequently cleaved by γ - secretase into p3 and AICD . Although all cells produce Aβ , it is generated in high levels by synaptic activity and its production and release are regulated by synaptic activity . Aβ levels are also modulated by the sleep–wake cycle. Aβ production and release into the extracellular space is higher during wakefulness and Aβ clearance through the glymphatic system is higher during sleep.   **a β 肽衍生自APP (一种单一的跨膜蛋白，在神经元突触中富集)** 后，APP被 β-分泌酶和 γ-分泌酶 (称为淀粉样蛋白生成途径) 切割 (图2)。A β 最丰富的物种是长度为27-43个氨基酸。产生后，a β 作为单体分泌到细胞外空间。由于其序列，a β (尤其是a β 42) 具有很高的聚集倾向，这种聚集倾向以浓度依赖的方式发生。除a β 外，在淀粉样蛋白生成途径中还形成了其他分子-apps β，β CTF和AICD。APP通过 α-分泌酶裂解产生apps α 和 α CTF并阻止a β 的形成; Α CTF随后被 γ-分泌酶裂解为p3和AICD。尽管所有细胞都产生a β，但它是由突触活性高水平产生的，其产生和释放受突触活性调节。A β 水平也受睡眠-觉醒周期的调节。**清醒时a β 产生和释放到细胞外空间较高，睡眠时通过淋巴系统的a β 清除率较高**

APP cleavage pathways. a | In the non- β - amyloid (Aβ ) pathway, successive cleavage by α - secretase leads to the formation of APPsα and α CTF, which in turn is cleaved by γ - secretase to yield the extracellular peptide p3 and the intracellular fragment AICD. APPsα may modulate synaptic transmission through a GABA receptor. b | Aβ is formed in the ‘amyloidogenic’ pathway by the successive cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β - secretase into APPsβ and β CTF, the latter being then subjected to γ - secretase, producing Aβ and AICD. β CTF plays a key role in early endosomal abnormalities in AD. Note that the production of Aβ is necessarily in equal amounts to AICD and APPsβ and in inverse amounts to p3 and APPsα 应用程序分裂途径。a | 在非 β-淀粉样蛋白 (a β) 途径中，α-分泌酶的连续裂解导致形成apps α 和 α CTF，进而被 γ-分泌酶裂解以产生细胞外肽p3和细胞内片段AICD。Apps α 可能通过GABA受体调节突触传递。b | a β 是通过 β-分泌酶将淀粉样前体蛋白 (APP) 连续裂解为apps β 和 β CTF而在 “淀粉样生成” 途径中形成的，然后使后者经历 γ-分泌酶，产生a β 和AICD。β CTF在AD的早期内体异常中起关键作用。请注意，a β 的产生必然与AICD和apps β 相等，与p3和apps α 相反。

ApoE and Aβ interaction. In one pathway, monomeric β - amyloid (Aβ ) aggregates into oligomers, then into fibrils and finally becomes part of amyloid plaques. ABCA1 participates in the lipidation of ApoE, which has a strong effect on Aβ fibrillization. ApoE complexes with Aβ monomers and, by interacting with the low- density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDL receptor- related protein 1 (LRP1), transports Aβ into the perivascular spaces around arterioles and venules for removal by the glymphatic pathway. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) also interacts with LRP1 and Aβ and influences its oligomerization. Within the perivascular space, Aβ can aggregate, which leads to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which in turn can damage the vascular wall, leading to microhaemorrhages. Through the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), lipoproteins, including ApoE, influence the phagocytic properties of microglia and might influence plaque removal. ApoE和a β 相互作用。在一个途径中，单体 β-淀粉样蛋白 (a β) 聚集成低聚物，然后聚集成原纤维，最后成为淀粉样蛋白斑块的一部分。ABCA1参与ApoE的脂化，对a β 纤化有很强的作用。*ApoE与a β 单体复合物*，并通过与*低密度脂蛋白受体 (LDLR)* 和LDL受体相关蛋白1 (LRP1) 相互作用，*将a β 转运到小动脉和小静脉周围的血管周围空间*，以*通过淋巴途径去除*。硫酸乙酰肝素蛋白聚糖 (HSPG) 也与LRP1和a β 相互作用，并影响其低聚。**在血管周围空间内，a β 会聚集，从而导致脑淀粉样血管病 (CAA)，进而损害血管壁，导致小出血**。通过在髓样细胞2 (TREM2) 上表达的触发受体，包括ApoE在内的脂蛋白会影响小胶质细胞的吞噬特性，并可能影响斑块的去除。

In keeping with the hypothesis that Aβ , particularly in its oligomeric form, is toxic, oligomeric Aβ interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and NMDA  receptors and seems to interact with several other receptors such as α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and insulin receptors. In addition, Aβ also seems to cause pathological changes in dendritic spines and synaptic efficiency. Although aggregated Aβ is the overt lesion that could cause neurotoxicity, dysregulated APP processing may also have ‘covert’ effects on synaptic function. APP cleavage products have normal physiological functions. For example, APPsα is a ligand for a subtype of GABA receptor that modulates synaptic transmission55 . In addition, other cleavage products, such as APPsβ and APPsη , have cellular receptors that suggest they might also modulate synaptic activity and non- Aβ fragments of APP, such as C- terminal fragments , seem to play a critical role in endosomal and lysosomal function.  与a β (尤其是寡聚形式) 有毒的假设保持一致，寡聚a β 与代谢型谷氨酸受体5和NMDA受体相互作用，并且似乎与其他几种受体 (例如 α7烟碱型乙酰胆碱受体和胰岛素受体) 相互作用。此外，a β 似乎也会引起树突棘和突触效率的病理变化。尽管聚集的a β 是可能引起神经毒性的明显病变，但*APP处理失调也可能对突触功能产生 “掩盖” 作用。APP裂解产品具有正常的生理功能*。例如，apps α 是调节突触传递55的GABA受体亚型的配体。此外，其他切割产物 (例如apps β 和apps η) 具有细胞受体，表明它们也可能调节突触活性，而APP的非a β 片段 (例如C末端片段) 似乎在内体和溶酶体中起关键作用功能。Tau is a microtubule- associated protein that is normally present in the cytoplasm of axons but is also present in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments and associated with the nuclear membrane . Tau occurs in six isoforms due to alternate splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10; the isoforms are named according to the presence of either three or four microtubule- binding domains as the 3R or 4R isoforms, respectively . The tau species that occurs in AD is a mixture of 3R and 4R tau. The main function of tau is microtubule stabilization . Tau may become prone to post- translational modifications and to aggregate. When this happens, it accumulates in a hyperphosphorylated form in cell bodies and dendrites. *Tau is released into the extracellular space by synaptic activity and is taken up in postsynaptic neurons and glia*  **Tau是一种微管相关蛋白，通常存在于轴突的细胞质中**，但也存在于突触前和突触后区室中，并与核膜相关。Tau由于外显子2、3和10的交替剪接而出现在六个同工型中; 这些同工型根据三个或四个微管结合域的存在分别命名为3R或4R同工型。发生在AD中的tau物种是3R和4R tau的混合物。tau的主要功能是微管稳定。**Tau可能容易发生翻译后修饰和聚集。当这种情况发生时，它以过度磷酸化的形式在细胞体和树突中积累** Tau通过突触活动释放到细胞外空间，并在突触后神经元和神经胶质中摄取。 Different post- translational modifications of tau might allow it to be differentially taken up in postsynaptic neurons or glia, differentially processed or truncated, or to cause seeded aggregation. In addition, tau  post- translational modifications affect the rate of AD progression . There is emerging evidence that ApoE, TREM2 and microglia play an important role in tau- mediated neurodegeneration although the mechanisms that relate presumed microglial activity to tau toxicity are unknown.  tau的不同翻译后修饰可能使其在突触后神经元或神经胶质中被差异占据，差异处理或截短，或引起种子聚集。此外，tau翻译后修饰会影响AD的进展速度。有新的证据表明，ApoE，TREM2和小胶质细胞在tau介导的神经变性中起重要作用，尽管推测的小胶质细胞活性与tau毒性有关的机制尚不清楚。Aggregated 3R and 4R tau appear histologically as neurofibrillary tangles (intracellular tau aggregates), neuropil threads (tau fragments in the neuropil) and dystrophic neurites (tau- containing degenerated axons and dendrites surrounding Aβ plaques). Although these structures can be seen in some brainstem nuclei in young adults, tauopathy in the medial temporal lobe is the initial site relevant to cognition. Medial temporal tauopathy may occur independently of Aβ pathology . In some patients in whom elevations in Aβ never occur, medial temporal tauopathy (referred to in these patients as primary age- related tauopathy) may persist without the involvement of other regions. However, tauopathy of the AD type progresses outside the medial temporal lobe only in those with elevated brain Aβ . Region- specific cognitive deficits occurring in MCI and dementia reflect the sequential expansion of tau accumulation from the medial temporal lobe to interconnected temporal, parietal and frontal association cortices (see Clinical manifestations).   聚集的3R和4R tau在组织学上表现为神经原纤维缠结 (细胞内tau聚集体)，神经pil线 (神经pil中的tau片段) 和营养不良性神经突 (含tau的变性轴突和a β 斑块周围的树突)。尽管在年轻人的某些脑干核中可以看到这些结构，但内侧颞叶的tau病是与认知相关的初始部位。内侧颞tau病可能独立于a β 病理发生。在某些从未发生过a β 升高的患者中，内侧颞tau病 (在这些患者中称为主要的年龄相关性tau病) 可能会持续存在，而不会涉及其他区域。然而，仅在大脑a β 升高的人群中，AD型tau病才在内侧颞叶外发展。MCI和痴呆中发生的区域特异性认知缺陷反映了tau积累从内侧颞叶到相互连接的颞，顶叶和额叶关联皮层的顺序扩张 (见临床表现)。Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is at the crossroads of clinical, genetic and cellular mechanistic aspects of AD. The APOE gene encodes the ApoE protein, which is produced in the brain predominantly by astrocytes and activated microglia . In humans, there are three common isoforms, ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4, which only differ by a single amino acid at position 112 or 158  . Carriers of the APOE ε 4 allele have a dose- dependent increased risk for AD dementia . There are several mechanisms by which ApoE may influence AD risk, one of which is by affecting the onset of Aβ aggregation in the brain by altering the clearance and seeding of Aβ (Fig. 3; also see Dysfunctional proteostasis, below). The three ApoE isoforms modulate Aβ clearance and seeding to varying extents, with ApoE4 having the strongest effect on the slowing of clearance, followed by ApoE3 then ApoE2 . Accordingly, APOE ε 4 carriage can cause early Aβ accumulation in a dose- dependent manner before the onset of clinical symptoms. Approximately 10% of APOE ε 4 carriers have increased Aβ by age 57 years (as assessed using Aβ - PET), while APOE e4 non- carriers have increased Aβ about 7 years later .  载脂蛋白E (ApoE) 处于ad的临床，遗传和细胞机理方面的十字路口。APOE基因编码**ApoE蛋白，该蛋白主要由星形胶质细胞和活化的小胶质细胞在大脑中产生**。在人类中，存在三种常见的同工型，ApoE2、ApoE3和ApoE4，它们仅在112位或158处的单个氨基酸不同。APOE ε 4等位基因的携带者患有AD痴呆的剂量依赖性风险增加。ApoE可以通过多种机制影响AD风险，其中之一是通过*改变a β 的清除和播种来影响大脑中a β 聚集的发作* (图3; 另见功能失调的蛋白质平衡，下面)。三种ApoE亚型在不同程度上调节a β 的清除率和播种，其中ApoE4对清除率的减慢作用最强，其次是ApoE3，然后是ApoE2。因此，apoeε4携带可在临床症状发作之前以剂量依赖性方式引起早期a β 积累。大约10% 的apoeε4携带者在57岁时增加了a β (如使用a β-PET评估)，而apoee4非携带者在大约7年后增加了a β。The precise mechanisms by which Aβ /APP and tau interact are not well understood . Transgenic mice with Aβ - overexpression with wild- type tau develop either no tauopathy or one that is dissimilar to AD. Transgenic animals that contain both APP and tau mutants have interactions between Aβ and tau but it is not clear whether this model system replicates human AD. Conceptually, there are several cellular systems in which Aβ /APP, tau and ApoE might interact: the synapse , in microglia and in the endosomal/ lysosomal/proteasomal system. Alternatively, neural systems that accumulate Aβ and those that accumulate tau might be distinct but interact primarily through the connectome。  **A β /APP和tau相互作用的确切机制尚不清楚**。具有野生型tau的a β 过表达的转基因小鼠要么没有tau病，要么与AD不同。同时包含APP和tau突变体的转基因动物在a β 和tau之间具有相互作用，但尚不清楚该模型系统是否复制人类AD。从概念上讲，存在几种细胞系统，其中a β /APP，tau和ApoE可能相互作用: 突触，小胶质细胞和内体/溶酶体/蛋白酶体系统。或者，积累a β 的神经系统和积累tau的神经系统可能是不同的，但主要通过连接体相互作用。

#### Loss of synaptic homeostasis 

Synaptic alterations are a central unifying theme to understand the relationship between Aβ and tau neuro­ toxicity, the morphological lesions of AD, and cognitive impairment. Synaptic loss is strongly correlated with cognition in patients with AD. Aβ plaques are surrounded by a ring of soluble oligomeric Aβ and decreased synaptic content that extends for ~50 μ m, marked by both a loss of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers; given the large number of cortical plaques in patients with AD, this amounts to a substantial number of lost synapses. Moreover, in animal models of plaque deposition in which there is little neuronal loss, an additional 25% loss of synaptic content in the neuropil between plaques can be observed ; it is likely that a similar phenomenon occurs in humans. These data suggest a strong interaction between the oligomeric Aβ species thought to surround plaques and the neuropil and synaptic toxicity. Tau- overexpressing transgenic animals have a similar loss of synapses, with tau accumulation in presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. These synaptic alterations seem to be synergistically amplified in mice when tau and Aβ mutant transgenes are included in the model . Patients with AD also have a marked loss of synapses closely associated in cross- sectional studies with the presence of neuronal loss, dendritic loss, loss of dendritic arborization and tangle formation . Importantly, synaptic loss is not simply a part of healthy ageing in the absence of AD pathology in most people; indeed, cross- sectional studies in human autopsy samples have suggested that synaptic loss can precede neurodegeneration in persons with symptomatic AD and, in animal models, it is evident that synapse loss can precede tangle formation .  突触改变是理解a β 和tau神经毒性、AD的形态学损伤和认知障碍之间关系的中心统一主题。**突触丧失与AD患者的认知密切相关**。a β 斑块被可溶性寡聚a β 环包围，突触含量减少，延伸约50μm，其特征是突触前和突触后标记物的丢失; 鉴于AD患者的皮质斑块数量众多，这相当于突触丢失的数量。此外，在几乎没有神经元损失的斑块沉积动物模型中，可以观察到斑块之间神经纤维中突触含量的额外25% 损失; 很可能在人类中发生类似现象。这些数据表明，被认为围绕斑块的寡聚a β 物种与神经纤维和突触毒性之间存在很强的相互作用。过表达Tau的转基因动物具有类似的突触丢失，tau在突触前和突触后位点积累。当模型中包含tau和a β 突变转基因时，这些突触改变似乎在小鼠中被协同扩增。在横断面研究中，AD患者也有明显的突触丢失，与神经元丢失，树突状缺失，树突状乔木化和缠结形成密切相关。重要的是，在大多数人没有AD病理的情况下，突触丧失不仅仅是健康衰老的一部分; 事实上，人类尸检样本的横断面研究表明，有症状的AD患者的突触丧失可能先于神经变性，**在动物模型中，很明显，突触丢失可以先于缠结形成**。In addition to a loss of synapses in AD, several studies in animal and laboratory models have suggested the involvement of synaptic dysfunction. In rodent transgenic Aβ models, there is hyperactivity of calcium flux in and around plaques, which can be normalized by inhibiting the generation of Aβ with BACE inhibitors。除了AD中突触的丢失外，在动物和实验室模型中的一些研究还表明**突触功能障碍也参与其中**。在啮齿动物转基因a β 模型中，斑块内及其周围存在**钙通量过度活跃**，可以通过用BACE抑制剂抑制a β 的产生来恢复正常 .How this hyperactivity affects cognitively eloquent neural circuitry is unknown but it is assumed that altered synaptic homeostasis plays a role . In mice with mutant tau transgenes, intracellular and extracellular recordings of neocortical pyramidal neurons show alterations in firing rates and firing patterns, implying alterations in basic electrophysiological homeostasis due to the tauopathy. When mice expressing human tau and Aβ were examined, there was a tau- dependent quieting of neural system activity in the parietal cortex  with or without neuronal loss, which was normalized by the suppression of tau expression. In this study, tau suppression decreased the amount of soluble tau without affecting aggregated tau, implicating soluble tau in the pathophysiology of AD. Collectively, these data imply that the soluble forms of oligomeric Aβ or of tau, rather than the aggregated forms, have the strongest effect on synaptic function.    这种多动症如何影响认知雄辩的神经回路尚不清楚，但假定突触稳态的改变起着作用。在具有突变tau转基因的小鼠中，新皮层锥体神经元的细胞内和细胞外记录显示出放电速率和放电模式的改变，这意味着由于tauopathy引起的基本电生理稳态的改变。当检查表达人类tau和a β 的小鼠时，顶叶皮层中存在tau依赖性的神经系统活动安静，有或没有神经元丢失，这通过抑制tau表达而标准化。在这项研究中，tau抑制降低了可溶性tau的含量，而不影响聚集的tau，这与AD的病理生理有关。总的来说，这些数据暗示寡聚a β 或tau的可溶形式，而不是聚集形式，对突触功能的影响最大。Synaptic alterations have consequences on downstream neural circuit integrity. In animal models, a reactive synaptogenesis occurs in the hippocampus after loss of the entorhinal–hippocampal perforant pathway and analogous alterations occur in the human hippocampus in AD. Whether this synaptogenesis has functional benefit remains unclear. Synaptic alterations can have remote consequences elsewhere in the brain and are therefore a prime explanation for the unique topographical character of AD, which is discussed further below. **突触改变会影响下游神经回路的完整性**。在动物模型中，在丧失内嗅-海马穿孔路径后，海马中发生了反应性突触形成，而在AD中，人海马中发生了类似的改变。这种突触发生是否具有功能益处仍不清楚。突触改变可能会在大脑的其他地方产生遥远的后果，因此是AD独特地形特征的主要解释，这将在下面进一步讨论。Synaptic activity is also a likely basis for the propagation of proteopathic seeds trans- synaptically. In AD, the secretion of tau from neurons has been suggested and, as tau release is activity dependent, a synaptic mechanism is implied. Moreover, in animal models, tau propagates across synapses to create cytoplasmic deposits in the downstream neurons, although it remains to be tested if these downstream neurons lose function. Synaptic breakdown may facilitate this trans- synaptic deposition of misfolded proteins as observed in an animal model of tau propagation64 . In addition, as proteopathic seeds can be taken up at the synapse via LRP1, which interacts with APP and ApoE , competing interactions with, for example, different ApoE isoforms or ApoE protein levels might affect tau propagation. Synaptic remodelling is a ubiquitous process in the normal brain. Synapses can be tagged for removal, primarily by microglia, which are able to strip synapses from intact dendrites. Dysfunction in the activation of synaptic pruning mechanisms by microglia, mediated in part by complement proteins and ApoE, among other molecules, have been implicated in early AD . The precise mechanism of this ‘tagging’ is unclear but altered clearance processes plausibly link synaptic dysfunction, innate immune mechanisms and the lysosomal, endosomal and autophagy mechanisms discussed below.  突触活性也是蛋白质性种子跨突触繁殖的可能基础。在AD中，已经提出了神经元分泌tau的过程，并且由于tau的释放取决于活动，因此暗示了突触机制。此外，在动物模型中，tau通过突触传播以在下游神经元中产生细胞质沉积物，尽管这些下游神经元是否失去功能仍有待测试。如在tau繁殖的动物模型64中观察到的，突触分解可能会促进错误折叠蛋白的这种跨突触沉积。此外，由于蛋白质种子可以通过LRP1在突触中吸收，LRP1与APP和ApoE相互作用，因此与例如不同的ApoE亚型或ApoE蛋白水平的竞争性相互作用可能会影响tau的繁殖。**突触重塑是正常大脑中普遍存在的过程。突触可以标记为去除，主要是通过小胶质细胞进行标记**，小胶质细胞能够从完整的树突中剥离突触。在早期AD中，小胶质细胞激活突触修剪机制的功能障碍 (部分由补体蛋白和ApoE等分子介导) 被暗示。这种 “标记” 的确切机制尚不清楚，但清除过程的改变似乎将突触功能障碍，先天免疫机制以及下面讨论的溶酶体，内体和自噬机制联系在一起。

Figure 4. Consequences of the endosomal–lysosomal network and autophagy dysfunction in AD. The endosomal–lysosomal pathway, consisting of early and late endosomes/multivesicular bodies and lysosomes, serves diverse functions in neurons relevant to Alzheimer disease (AD). In AD, the earliest changes seen in the brain are swelling of neuronal Rab5- endosomes, reflecting the hyper- activation of Rab5 (Rab5- GTP) by amyloid precursor protein (APP)- β CTF or neuronal overexpression of Rab5. Increased Rab5 activation leads to endosome enlargement and increased endocytosis, which have several cellular consequences relevant for AD. For example, increased endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) leads to defects in synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine shrinkage and loss. In addition, abnormal growth factor/receptormediated signalling results in the downregulation of AKT- mediated pro- survival signalling and increased GSK-3β - mediated tau hyperphosphorylation (p- tau). Corresponding endosomal–lysosomal activities in astrocytes and microglia coordinate bi- directional trafficking of cargo into and out of cells to maintain them and support the clearance of extracellular material in partnership with autophagy. Autophagy encompasses several mechanisms of constituent delivery to lysosomes, including initial entry of the substrate into late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (microautophagy), chaperone- mediated delivery directly to lysosomes, or macroautophagy, the major route depicted here. The increased induction of autophagy, a cellular stress response, becomes counter- productive as the functioning of autolysosomes and lysosomes is progressively corrupted due to multiple genetic and environmental factors. The result is a substantial build- up of autophagic vacuoles, mainly poorly acidified autolysosomes incompetent in clearing Aβ and β CTF, causing a unique pattern of perikaryal membrane blebbing, trafficking deficits producing autophagic vacuole- filled swellings along axons (dystrophic neurites), and accelerated peri- nuclear Aβ aggregation preceding advanced neuronal degeneration and disintegration, initiating senile plaque formation. An ensuing inflammatory response involving the recruitment of phagocytic microglia to compromised neurons/neurites and a release of damaging cytokines as the extracellular debris is being cleared increases bystander neurotoxicity, affecting neighbouring neurons and senile plaque expansion.

#### Dysfunctional proteostasis 功能失调的蛋白质稳态

The clearance of damaged proteins is integral to maintaining synaptic homeostasis and the neuronal lysosome (Fig. 4) plays an important role in the aetiology of AD . In the context of normal brain health, the **endosomal–lysosomal network (ELN)** and autophagy are involved in memory and cognition, with local autophagy activity at synapses modulating memory formation and *autophagy induction attenuating age- related memory decline*. Aβ and the β CTF peptide arising from the β - secretase cleavage of APP are generated mainly within endosomes, which are the first neuronal organelles known to exhibit AD- specific neuropathology . Lysosomes are the principal sites for the clearance of intracellular Aβ and β CTF . In AD, Aβ and β CTF accumulate abnormally in ELN compartments In induced pluripotent stem cell lines with APP and PSEN1 mutations, endosomal abnormalities occur that are correlated with β CTF but not with Aβ . β CTF induces the overactivation of Rab5, a GTPase, which causes several endosome morphological anomalies that occur in early AD such as accelerated endocytosis, impaired transport of enlarged endosomes and other neurodegenerative processes . In mouse AD models, elevated levels of Rab5 signalling due to β CTF elevations induce synaptic plasticity deficits, tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration. The build- up of β CTF and oxidized substrates, including Aβ , progressively impairs lysosome function and causes autophagy failure .  受损蛋白质的清除是维持突触稳态的重要组成部分，神经元溶酶体 (图4) 在AD的病因中起着重要作用。在正常大脑健康的背景下，**内体-溶酶体网络 (ELN)** 和自噬参与记忆和认知，突触处的局部自噬活动调节记忆形成，自噬诱导减弱与年龄相关的记忆衰退。由APP的 β-分泌酶切割产生的a β 和 β CTF肽主要在内体内产生，*内体是已知的第一个表现出AD特异性神经病理学的神经元细胞器*。溶酶体是清除细胞内a β 和 β CTF的主要部位。在AD中，a β 和 β CTF在具有APP和PSEN1突变的诱导多能干细胞系的ELN区室中异常积累，发生与 β CTF相关但与a β 无关的内体异常。Β CTF诱导Rab5 (一种GTPase) 的过度激活，从而导致AD早期发生的一些内体形态异常，例如加速内吞作用，扩大的内体运输受损和其他神经退行性过程。在小鼠AD模型中，由于 β CTF升高而导致的Rab5信号水平升高会导致突触可塑性缺陷，tau过度磷酸化和神经变性。Β CTF和氧化底物 (包括a β) 的积累逐渐损害溶酶体功能并导致自噬失败。Presenilins 1 and 2 are also preferentially localized within the ELN and presenilin 1 is essential for lysosome acidification. Loss- of- function mutations or deletion of PSEN1, independently of γ - secretase, prevent the normal assembly of the lysosomal v- ATPase complex, the proton pump responsible for acidification, and impede the lysosomal delivery of ClC7, a chloride ion channel also essential for lysosomal acidification in mice and in human fibroblast cultures. Lysosomal pH dysregulation can instigate broad functional derangements beyond proteostasis, including the effects on synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter exocytic release, and synaptic vesicle fusion and recycling. APOE ε 4 carriage has allele- specific effects at every ELN level, from accelerating and accentuating endosome dysfunction and impeding exosome release to causing lysosomal expansion and lysosomal membrane permeabilization.  早老素1和2也优先位于ELN内，早老素1对于溶酶体酸化至关重要。PSEN1的功能丧失突变或缺失，独立于 γ-分泌酶，阻止了负责酸化的质子泵溶酶体v- ATPase复合物的正常组装，并阻碍了ClC7的溶酶体递送，氯离子通道对于小鼠和人类成纤维细胞培养物中的溶酶体酸化也至关重要。溶酶体pH调节失调可引起蛋白质平衡以外的广泛功能紊乱，包括对突触可塑性，神经递质胞外释放以及突触小泡融合和再循环的影响。APOE ε4携带在每个ELN水平上都具有等位基因特异性作用，从加速和加剧内体功能障碍和阻止外体释放到引起溶酶体扩增和溶酶体膜通透性。Autophagy has several functions that are relevant for AD, primarily proteostasis but also homeostatic cell signalling, phagocytosis, innate immunity and synaptic function . Macroautophagy is induced by nutrient or metabolic stress and recycles non- essential substrates for energy or selectively targets protein aggregates and damaged organelles . The early induction of macroautophagy in AD is neuroprotective against ageing- related and disease- related sources of oxidative stress ; however, continued high rates of delivery of oxidized or damaged cytoplasmic constituents, such as mitochondria, Aβ and other APP products, to lysosomes later in disease overburdens an already compromised lysosomal system, resulting in a substantial accumulation of waste in neurons. Accordingly, dystrophic neurites become engorged with waste- filled autophagic vacuoles that contain high levels of APP, β - secretases and γ - secretases, and APP metabolites. Although neurons can survive for years with neuritic dystrophy, eventual autophagic vacuole accumulation in the perikarya leads to more rapid autophagy failure and neurodegeneration (Fig. 4) . Lysosomal membrane- damaging events, induced by Aβ and other oxidized substrates, trigger the death of neurons and microglia by lysosomal membrane permeabilization, which releases cathepsins that can activate cell death cascades.  自噬具有与AD相关的多种功能，主要是蛋白质平衡，但也有稳态细胞信号传导，吞噬作用，先天免疫和突触功能。巨自噬由营养或代谢应激诱导，并回收非必需底物以获取能量或选择性靶向蛋白质聚集体和受损细胞器。在AD中早期诱导大自噬是针对衰老相关和疾病相关的氧化应激来源的神经保护; 然而，在疾病后期，将氧化或受损的细胞质成分 (例如线粒体，a β 和其他APP产品) 持续高递送至溶酶体，使已经受损的溶酶体系统负担过重，导致神经元大量积累废物。因此，营养不良的神经突被充满废物的自噬液泡充盈，其中含有高水平的APP，β-分泌酶和 γ-分泌酶以及APP代谢物。尽管神经元可以在神经性营养不良的情况下存活数年，但最终自噬液泡在周围核中的积累会导致更快速的自噬衰竭和神经变性 (图4)。由a β 和其他氧化底物诱导的溶酶体膜损伤事件通过溶酶体膜透化触发神经元和小胶质细胞的死亡，从而释放可激活细胞死亡级联的组织蛋白酶。Microglia- expressed genes and genes involved in the complement pathway are risk genes for AD, implying the relevance of microglia and neuroinflammatory mechanisms in AD . Activated microglia play a key role in AD pathogenesis and link synaptic life cycles and innate immunity to the ELN functions. Microglial lysosomal membrane permeabilization events underlie the brain’s principal inflammatory response and the release of cytokines, particularly IL-1β , which is thought to exacerbate neurodegeneration in AD . Cathepsin B released by lysosomal permeabilization events into the cytosol facilitates the assembly of the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome and activates caspase 1, which is responsible for the maturation and extracellular discharge of cytotoxic IL-1β that subsequently fuels brain inflammation . The concept of an “autophagy- brake regulation” of inflammation reflects evidence that autophagy suppresses inflammasome activation and IL-1β release , both of which are elevated when autophagy is impaired in AD and ageing. The role of the microglial protein TREM2 in AD pathogenesis is complex and may differ at the various disease stages. It might be expected that altered autophagy and ELN function would affect synaptic pruning and therefore the integrity of normal synaptic connectivity but there is not a clear demonstration of the interrelationship of these two systems in human AD.  **小胶质细胞表达的基因和参与补体途径的基因是AD的危险基因，暗示了小胶质细胞与AD神经炎症机制的相关性**。活化的小胶质细胞在AD发病机理中起关键作用，并将突触生命周期和先天免疫与ELN功能联系起来。小胶质细胞溶酶体膜通透性事件是大脑主要的炎症反应和细胞因子 (尤其是IL-1β) 的释放的基础，IL-1β 被认为会加剧AD的神经变性。通过溶酶体通透事件释放到细胞质中的组织蛋白酶B促进了小胶质细胞NLRP3炎症小体的组装并激活了caspase 1，caspase 1负责细胞毒性IL-1β 的成熟和细胞外释放，随后加剧了大脑炎症。炎症的 “自噬制动调节” 的概念反映了自噬抑制炎症小体激活和IL-1β 释放的证据，当自噬在AD和衰老中受损时，两者都会升高。小胶质细胞蛋白TREM2在AD发病机理中的作用很复杂，并且在各个疾病阶段可能有所不同。可以预期，自噬和ELN功能的改变会影响突触修剪，从而影响正常突触连通性的完整性，但尚未明确证明这两个系统在人类AD中的相互关系。Aβ , tau or other potentially toxic molecules released by dying cells or by aberrant exocytic mechanisms into the extracellular space are degraded by various proteases , complementing clearance by microglia and astrocytes through endocytic uptake and lysosomal degradation. Molecular chaperones, such as the AD risk factor clusterin, facilitate this glial uptake. These clearance routes, in addition to the brain glymphatic system for the clearance of extracellular pathogenetic proteins through the lymphatic system, help protect against the transneuronal propagation of tau species.   A β，tau或其他由垂死细胞或异常的胞外机制释放到细胞外空间的潜在毒性分子被各种蛋白酶降解，小胶质细胞和星形胶质细胞通过内吞摄取和溶酶体降解补充清除。分子伴侣，如AD危险因子簇蛋白，促进这种神经胶质摄取。这些清除途径，除了用于通过淋巴系统清除细胞外致病蛋白的脑淋巴系统外，还有助于防止tau物种的跨神经元传播。

  

#### Aβ, tau and cortical networks 

**Network connections** have a **defining** role in the **initial location of Aβ deposits and may be responsible for the early location and progression of tauopathy** through the brain. A central element of AD as a synaptic disorder is the remarkable regional specificity of Aβ and tau accumulation and the extent to which clinical symptoms map on to the latter. 网络连接在 Aβ 沉积物的初始位置中具有决定性作用，并且可能是导致 tau 病变通过大脑的早期定位和进展的原因。 AD 作为一种突触障碍的核心要素是 Aβ 和 tau 积聚的显着区域特异性以及临床症状映射到后者的程度。Traditional neuroanatomical investigations established the strong interconnectivity between the entorhinal cortex, the locus of initial cerebral neurofibrillary tangle deposition in AD, and association areas of the temporal, parietal and frontal isocortex. Functional MRI replicated this connectivity in healthy humans and also demonstrated the dysfunction of these pathways in symptomatic AD. Aβ deposition occurs in a network- specific pattern in regions comprising the *default mode network (DMN)*, a group of areas that are active when the individual is not focused on the external environment and which includes the posterior cingulate gyrus and two subsystems (a medial frontal one and a medial temporal one). The association between Aβ deposition and the DMN shows that Aβ accumulates in brain regions with the highest synaptic activity (and, therefore, also regions with the greatest stress on the resident autophagy and ELN). The number of functional connections or the degree of ‘hubness’, which is another measure of synaptic load, is predictive of the amount of measured Aβ in a brain region .  传统的神经解剖学研究建立了内嗅皮层，AD中最初的脑神经原纤维缠结沉积部位以及颞，顶叶和额叶等皮质的关联区域之间的强相互连接。功能性MRI在健康人中复制了这种连通性，并且还证明了有症状的AD中这些途径的功能障碍。a β 沉积以网络特定模式发生在包括默认模式网络 (DMN) 的区域中，*默认模式网络 (DMN) 是一组区域，当个体不专注于外部环境时处于活动状态，并且包括后扣带回和两个子系统 (内侧额叶和内侧颞叶)*。A β 沉积与DMN之间的关联表明，*a β 积累在突触活性最高的大脑区域* (因此，也是对常驻自噬和ELN压力最大的区域) 中。功能连接的数量或 “紧张” 程度是突触负荷的另一种度量，可以预测大脑区域中测得的a β 的量。Tauopathy occurs in networks other than the DMN that support specific cognitive domains and are impaired in symptomatic AD , with clinical phenotype- specific changes in functional networks as measured with functional MRI156 or FDG- PET Regions that are connected to loci with a high tau abundance are more likely to experience an increase in tau accumulation. The major patterns of tau deposition observed with tau- PET show a spatial correspondence to connectivity patterns with variation by clinical phenotypes (see Clinical diagnosis). Of note, in contrast to tau, there is no evidence of significant phenotypic variance in this macroscopic Aβ pattern.  Tauopathy发生在支持特定认知域的DMN以外的网络中，并且在有症状的AD中受损，如功能性MRI156或fdg-pet区域所测量的，功能网络的临床表型特异性变化与具有高tau丰度的基因座有关更可能经历tau积累的增加。*用tau- PET观察到的tau沉积的主要模式显示出与连接模式的空间对应关系，并随临床表型的变化而变化* (请参见临床诊断)。值得注意的是，与tau相反，没有证据表明这种宏观a β 模式存在显着的表型差异。The functional activity of the connectome could selectively alter synaptic homeostasis in a way that offers a plausible account for the co- occurrence of APP/Aβ and tau pathology in AD. In persons without elevated Aβ assessed using PET, those who eventually develop elevated Aβ had DMN hyperconnectivity and increased glucose uptake compared with those who did not later develop increased Aβ  . The loss of homeostasis in areas of high synaptic activity in the DMN could induce dysfunction as well as the loss of homeostasis in remote but connected brain regions that depend on the DMN for proper functioning (such as the medial temporal lobe), a so- called cascading network failure . One such region of synaptic dysfunction and early Aβ accumulation, the posterior cingulate cortex, is strongly connected to the medial temporal lobe . The downstream synaptic stress, which is indexed by Aβ accumulation in  the posterior cingulate , is a plausible account of the propensity of the medial temporal lobes to accumulate tau when it loses functional support from the DMN (Supplementary Figure 1). Over a timeframe exceeding a decade or longer, synaptic dysfunction that leads to Aβ accumulation in the DMN could accelerate tauopathy in strongly linked functional modules . Subsequently, the transition from no symptoms to dementia in AD more closely fit with pathological tau expansion from the medial temporal lobe to functionally connected isocortical regions.  连接体的功能活性可以选择性地改变突触的稳态，从而为AD中APP/a β 和tau病理的同时发生提供了合理的解释。在使用PET评估的a β 没有升高的人中，与那些后来没有出现a β 升高的人相比，最终发展为a β 升高的人具有DMN高连通性和葡萄糖摄取增加。DMN中高突触活动区域的稳态丧失可能会导致功能障碍以及依赖DMN正常功能的偏远但相连的大脑区域 (例如内侧颞叶) 的稳态丧失，即所谓的级联网络故障。突触功能障碍和早期a β 积累的一个区域，即后扣带回皮层，与内侧颞叶紧密相连。下游突触应力 (由后扣带回中的a β 积累所指示) 是内侧颞叶在失去DMN功能支持时积聚tau的倾向的合理解释 (补充图1)。在超过十年或更长时间的时间范围内，导致DMN中a β 积累的突触功能障碍可能会加速紧密相连的功能模块中的tau病。随后，AD中从无症状到痴呆的转变与从内侧颞叶到功能连接的等皮质区域的病理性tau扩张更加紧密地吻合。

### Diagnosis, screening and prevention
### Clinical manifestations 
The severity of cognitive impairment caused by AD ranges from no cognitive impairment to dementia, which includes subjective cognitive impairment and MCI (Fig. 5) . The principal cognitive domains that are affected in AD are memory, language, visuospatial function, and executive function and one or more cognitive domains may be affected at any severity of cognitive impairment. The clinical presentations of persons with AD pathology are further modified by the co- presence of non- AD pathologies. AD引起的认知障碍的严重程度从无认知障碍到痴呆，包括主观认知障碍和MCI(图5)。阿尔茨海默病主要影响的认知领域是记忆、语言、视觉空间功能和执行功能，任何严重程度的认知障碍都可能影响一个或多个认知领域。有AD病理的人的临床表现被非AD病理的共同存在进一步改变。The prototypical patient with AD is one with amnestic MCI progressing to variable degrees of impairment in language, spatial cognition, executive function or working memory that interfere with daily functioning (that is, multidomain dementia). Amnestic presentations are most common with later age of onset (> 70 years) while non- amnestic presentations are common in younger persons. The initial appearance and progression of cognitive deficits in typical AD MCI and dementia follow the spread of tauopathy from the medial temporal lobe to the lateral temporal, parietal and frontal isocortex . Neuropsychiatric symptoms often co- occur with cognitive deficits, of which depression, anxiety and social withdrawal may be most evident in mild dementia whereas delusions, hallucinations, emotional dyscontrol or physically aggressive behaviours may be observed in more advanced stages  典型的AD患者是遗忘性MCI在语言，空间认知，执行功能或工作记忆方面发展到不同程度的损害，从而干扰日常功能 (即多域痴呆)。遗忘表现最常见于发病年龄较晚 ( > 70岁)，而非遗忘表现常见于年轻人。典型的AD MCI和痴呆症的认知缺陷的最初出现和进展是随着tauopathy从内侧颞叶扩散到外侧颞叶，顶叶和额叶等皮质。神经精神症状通常与认知缺陷同时发生，其中抑郁，焦虑和社交退缩在轻度痴呆中最为明显，而在更高级阶段可能会观察到妄想，幻觉，情绪控制障碍或身体攻击行为

Terminologies for characterizing cognitive impairment. Several different terminology schemes can be used to classify the severity of cognitive impairment from cognitively normal (CN) to dementia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) uses the terms Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD) and Major NCD to describe symptomatic states. The National Institute of Ageing – Alzheimer’s Association (NIA- AA) Alzheimer disease (AD) framework uses clinical syndromes and defines a six- stage scheme for individuals who have abnormal β - amyloid biomarkers (ST1–ST6) . In the NIA- AA scheme, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) encompasses both stages 2 and 3. The NIA- AA continuum has evolved slightly at the boundary between cognitively unimpaired (CU) and MCI. The International Work Group (IWG) labels were retrieved from REF 283 . The terms CN and CU are equivalent, but the latter is preferred because CU better reflects its definition as the absence of cognitive impairment.  表征认知障碍的术语。可以使用几种不同的术语方案来将认知障碍的严重程度从认知正常 (CN) 分类为痴呆症。精神障碍诊断和统计手册 (DSM-5) 使用轻度神经认知障碍 (NCD) 和主要NCD来描述症状状态。美国国家老龄研究所-阿尔茨海默病协会 (NIA- AA) 阿尔茨海默病 (AD) 框架使用临床综合征，并为 β-淀粉样蛋白生物标志物 (ST1-ST6) 异常的个体定义了六阶段方案。在NIA- AA方案中，轻度认知障碍 (MCI) 包括第2阶段和第3阶段。NIA- AA连续体在认知未受损 (CU) 和MCI之间的边界略有演变。从参考文献283检索国际工作组 (IWG) 标签。术语CN和CU是等效的，但后者是首选，因为CU更好地反映了其定义为没有认知障碍。AD can also manifest in its earliest symptomatic form with non- amnestic deficits. A common non- amnestic AD clinical presentation — known as posterior cortical atrophy or the visual variant of AD — encompasses prominent visuospatial difficulties, including challenges in reading, face recognition or difficulties processing complex visual scenes. The logopenic form of primary progressive aphasia is another non- amnestic form of AD, which typically manifests as a non- fluent aphasia with prominent word- finding pauses, naming and repetition difficulties; approximately 60% of these persons will have underlying AD. In addition, a dysexecutive presentation of AD is being recognized more frequently particularly in younger patients . These patients have challenges in executive function, multi- tasking, decision- making and behavioural changes with preserved memory function . The non- amnestic syndromes of AD are more common in persons aged < 70 years although the underlying reasons for this observation are unknown. Both the amnestic and non- amnestic presentations of AD have Aβ deposition throughout the brain but have syndrome- specific distributions of tauopathy .  AD也可以以其最早的症状形式表现为非遗忘性缺陷。常见的非遗忘性AD临床表现-称为后皮质萎缩或AD的视觉变体-包含突出的视觉空间困难，包括阅读，面部识别或复杂视觉场景处理困难。原发性进行性失语症的失语症形式是AD的另一种非遗忘形式，通常表现为不流利的失语症，具有突出的单词查找停顿，命名和重复困难; 这些人中约有60% 人具有潜在的AD。此外，尤其是在年轻患者中，AD的执行不良表现越来越被人们所认识。这些患者在执行功能，多任务处理，决策和行为改变方面具有保留记忆功能的挑战。AD的非遗忘综合征在70岁以下人群中更为常见，尽管这种观察的根本原因尚不清楚。AD的遗忘和非遗忘表现在整个大脑中都有a β 沉积，但具有tauopathy的综合征特异性分布。

#### Clinical diagnosis 
##### Diagnosis in individuals with cognitive complaints
Diagnosis in individuals with cognitive complaints. Clinical diagnosis in the setting where a patient, family member or health professional raises concerns about cognitive decline or dysfunction in the patient is of paramount importance in the overall care of persons with cognitive impairment. Although the level of awareness of dementia has greatly improved in the primary care and specialist communities, heightened awareness of the early signs of cognitive impairment in the clinical setting is still needed. 对有认知障碍的患者的诊断。在患者、家属或卫生专业人员对患者认知能力下降或功能障碍提出担忧的情况下，临床诊断对认知障碍患者的整体护理至关重要。虽然初级保健和专家社区对痴呆症的认识水平已大大提高，但仍需要提高对临床环境中认知障碍的早期迹象的认识。The diagnostic process begins with a determination of the presence and severity of cognitive impairment.  Information from an individual who is familiar with the patient’s daily life and the completion of a cognitive evaluation of the patient (a mental status examination) by a skilled clinician are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Neuropsychological testing can be beneficial to determine the severity of cognitive impairment in mild or high- functioning patients and can identify the involved cognitive domains, which can help the clinician with prognostication and with considerations about the underlying aetiology. This tentative diagnosis can then be confirmed with biomarkers. Although technology can assist in formulating a diagnosis, diagnosis rests on the skill of the clinician in integrating information from the informant, the mental status examination, the neurological examination and the technology. If cognitive impairment is diagnosed, a provisional determination of aetiology is made based on information from the history, the informant, the mental status examination (supplemented by neuropsychological testing in some circumstances) and the rest of the neurological examination. 诊断过程始于认知障碍的存在和严重程度的确定。来自熟悉患者日常生活的个人的信息和熟练的临床医生对患者的认知评估(精神状态检查)的完成是诊断的基石。神经心理测试可以有助于确定轻度或高功能患者认知障碍的严重程度，并可以识别涉及的认知领域，这可以帮助临床医生预测预后，并考虑潜在的病因。这种初步诊断可以用生物标记物来证实。虽然技术可以帮助制定诊断，但诊断依赖于临床医生整合信息的技能，包括信息提供者、精神状态检查、神经系统检查和技术。如果诊断出认知障碍，则根据病史、举报人、精神状态检查(在某些情况下辅以神经心理测试)和其他神经学检查，初步确定病因。AD is not the only cause of MCI (Fig. 1) . Any neuro­ degenerative or cerebrovascular aetiology could initially lead to MCI and mild overt symptomatic cognitive impairment could be due to depression, medication misuse or obstructive sleep apnoea. In persons with MCI or dementia, screening for hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency and structural brain lesions, such as neoplasms or subdural hematomas, should be performed, even though the yield of clinically relevant abnormalities is low . Once persons reach the dementia stage, reversible conditions are very unlikely but a number of non- AD conditions have clinical phenotypes that overlap with AD such as Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degenerations and hippocampal sclerosis. Thus, the consideration of alternative aetiologies should occur during the diagnostic evaluation of persons with MCI or dementia in whom AD is suspected. Features of the clinical presentation are the initial clue that a non- AD process may be present.  **AD并不是MCI的唯一原因** (图1)。任何神经变性或脑血管病因最初可能导致MCI，轻度明显的症状性认知障碍可能是由于抑郁，药物滥用或阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停。对于MCI或痴呆患者，即使临床相关异常的发生率较低，也应进行甲状腺功能减退，B12缺乏症和结构性脑部病变 (例如肿瘤或硬膜下血肿) 的筛查。一旦人们进入痴呆阶段，可逆的疾病就不太可能发生，但是许多非AD疾病的临床表型与AD重叠，例如路易体病，额颞叶变性和海马硬化。因此，在对怀疑有AD的MCI或痴呆患者进行诊断评估时，应考虑其他病因。临床表现的特征是可能存在非AD过程的最初线索。

##### Screening in those with no cognitive complaints. 
Screening for objective evidence of cognitive impairment in the absence of cognitive complaints is not recommended. This topic has been quite controversial . The United States Preventive Services Task Force has repeatedly indicated that there are insufficient data on improved patient outcomes to recommend the utility of cognitive screening. One problem with screening is that the cognitive assessments used for screening lack precision, especially for the detection of milder cognitive impairment. However, in support of screening, the recognition of cognitive limitations in patients by health- care practitioners, even in the absence of cognitive complaints, may be informative as unacknowledged cognitive impairment may have dramatic effects on the adherence to recommended medical interventions or other healthy living activities. Should disease- modifying therapies for AD become available, screening will take on increasing importance despite the challenges in designing studies to address screening.  对那些*没有认知障碍的人*进行筛查。*不建议*在没有认知抱怨的情况下*筛查*认知障碍的客观证据。这个话题一直颇有争议。美国预防服务工作组一再指出，关于改善患者预后的数据不足，无法推荐认知筛查的实用性。筛查的一个问题是，用于筛查的认知评估*缺乏准确性*，尤其是对于轻度认知障碍的检测。然而，为了支持筛查，即使在没有认知主诉的情况下，医疗保健从业人员对患者认知局限性的认识也可能是有益的，因为未承认的认知障碍可能会对坚持推荐的医疗干预措施或其他健康生活活动产生重大影响。如果可以使用针对AD的疾病改良疗法，尽管在设计针对筛查的研究方面存在挑战，但筛查将变得越来越重要。

### Biomarkers

AD- specific antemortem biomarkers used in the context of careful clinical characterization has helped to establish levels of certainty for an AD pathology that was impossible when the only means of verification of the underlying pathology was at autopsy. In addition, the use of these biomarkers has enhanced our knowledge of AD. Combining amyloid and tau biomarkers with non- specific biomarkers of neurodegeneration was at the core of the research framework for AD proposed in 2018 . The A- T- N approach is intended to classify individuals in the AD spectrum (Fig. 6) . Diagnostic algorithms are being developed to provide recommendations on the most meaningful combination and to order these biomarkers according to the specific clinical situation.  在仔细的临床表征的背景下使用的AD特异性死前生物标志物有助于建立AD病理的确定性水平，而当验证潜在病理的唯一方法是尸检时，这是不可能的。此外，这些生物标志物的使用增强了我们对AD的了解。将淀粉样蛋白和tau生物标志物与神经变性的非特异性生物标志物相结合是AD提出的2018年研究框架的核心。**A- T- N方法旨在对AD频谱中的个体进行分类 (图6)**。正在开发诊断算法，以提供有关最有意义的组合的建议，并根据特定的临床情况对这些生物标志物进行排序。
![[Pasted image 20230113223701.png]]
Conceptualizing the A-T-N scheme. Cerebrospinal fluid and PET imaging biomarkers can be grouped into those that proxy amyloid- β (Aβ ; “A”), abnormal tau protein (“T”) or neurodegeneration (“N”). The *A biomarkers* derived from *PET* and cerebrospinal fluid (*CSF*) have an *inverse relationship* such that higher Aβ - PET corresponds to lower levels of CSF Aβ . The *“T” biomarkers* derived from *PET and CSF* are *both abnormal at higher* values. Quantitatively, tau- PET provides both a measure of regional tau abundance and distribution, whereas CSF p- tau181 or p- tau217 offer only a metric of normal or abnormal tau levels. The “*N*” markers, by virtue of their lack of specificity to Alzheimer disease (AD) and their heterogeneous underlying biologies, are generally *not well correlated* with one another. Biomarkers for AD can indicate whether a person is in the AD spectrum (state biomarkers) that include Aβ abnormalities and elevated tau biomarkers. Biomarkers can also be used to indicate the severity of the AD process (stage biomarkers) that include tau- PET and the neurodegeneration biomarkers. NfL, neurofilament light chain. 概念化A-T-N方案。脑脊液和PET成像生物标志物可以被归类为淀粉样蛋白- β (Aβ;“A”)、tau蛋白异常(“T”)或神经退化(“N”)。从PET和脑脊液(CSF)中提取的A生物标志物具有相反的关系，即较高的Aβ - PET对应较低的CSF Aβ水平。从PET和CSF中提取的T标记物在较高值时都是异常的。在数量上，tau- PET提供了区域tau丰度和分布的度量，而CSF p- tau181或p- tau217仅提供了正常或异常tau水平的度量。由于“N”标记物对阿尔茨海默病(AD)缺乏特异性，且其基础生物学异质性较强，因此通常相互之间不太相关。AD的生物标志物可以表明一个人是否属于AD谱系(状态生物标志物)，包括a β异常和升高的tau生物标志物。生物标志物也可以用来指示AD过程的严重程度(阶段生物标志物)，包括tau- PET和神经退行性变生物标志物。NfL，神经纤维轻链。

#### Imaging biomarkers. 
CT, FDG- PET and MRI were the first imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with cognitive impairment but their lack of specificity or sensitivity for AD was difficult to integrate into a conceptual model of AD. The introduction of Aβ - PET imaging in 2004 (ref. 182) clarified the roles of FDG- PET and MRI as  markers of neurodegeneration, whereas CT was superseded by MRI for research purposes. The 2011 National Institute of Ageing – Alzheimer’s Association criteria183 introduced a diagnostic model using amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarker profiles to characterize the relationship with AD in individuals across the cognitive spectrum. 成像生物标志物。CT、FDG- PET和MRI是第一个用于评估认知障碍患者的影像学模式，但它们对AD缺乏特异性或敏感性，很难纳入AD的概念模型。Aβ - PET成像在2004年的引入(参考文献182)明确了FDG- PET和MRI作为神经退行性变标志物的作用，而在研究目的上CT被MRI取代。2011年国家老年痴呆症协会标准引入了一种诊断模型，使用淀粉样蛋白和神经退行性变生物标志物谱来描述整个认知谱系中个体与AD的关系。Structural MRI or CT are necessary in the initial evaluation of a person with suspected cognitive impairment. MRI is often used as a first step to exclude other causes of cognitive impairment and it also allows the assessment of macroscopic brain atrophy as a reflection of tissue loss. Of note, individuals with cognitive impairment and increased Aβ by PET experience accelerated regional atrophy in the temporal and parietal isocortex compared with those without elevated Aβ, with larger volume losses correlating with advancing cognitive impairment . Hippocampal atrophy observed with MRI is associated with AD but it can also occur in individuals with cognitive impairment caused by hippo­ campal sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration or cerebrovascular disease as well as in persons without cognitive impairement . In younger persons with AD dementia, hippocampal sparing is common. Structural imaging may be used to support a diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy variant of AD, the most common of the younger- onset, hippocampal- sparing AD variants. Although there is a global reduction in brain volume in AD owing to the loss of synapses, dendrites and neuronal cell bodies, global brain volume loss is not diagnostically useful because it is not specific for AD.  在对怀疑有认知障碍的人进行初步评估时，必须进行结构MRI或CT。MRI通常被用作排除其他认知障碍原因的第一步，并且还可以评估宏观脑萎缩作为组织损失的反映。值得注意的是，与没有a β 升高的个体相比，认知障碍和PET引起的a β 增加的个体在颞叶和顶叶等皮质的区域萎缩加速，并且体积损失更大与认知障碍的发展相关。*MRI观察到的海马萎缩与AD有关，但也可能发生在由海马硬化，额颞叶变性或脑血管疾病引起的认知障碍的个体中，以及没有认知障碍的人*。在患有*AD痴呆的年轻人中，海马保留很常见*。结构成像可用于支持诊断AD的后皮质萎缩变异体，这是最常见的年轻发作的，保留海马的AD变异体。尽管由于突触，树突和神经元细胞体的丧失，AD的大脑体积总体减少，但*总体大脑体积的丧失在诊断上没有用处，因为它不是特定于AD的*。Structural MRI is also useful to assess patients for cerebral microbleeds that occur as a consequence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral microbleeds are common in the elderly; in a population- based study, 39% of persons without dementia over the age of 80 years had at least one cerebral microbleed and the burden of cerebral microbleeds was correlated with Aβ - PET levels .  The impact of cerebral microbleeds on cognition is modest but difficult to disentangle from the role of the underlying AD pathology.  结构MRI还可用于评估患者因脑淀粉样血管病而发生的脑微出血。脑微出血在老年人中很常见; 在一项基于人群的研究中，39% 的80岁以上无痴呆症的人至少有一次脑微出血，并且*脑微出血的负担与a β-PET水平相关*。脑微出血对认知的影响不大，但很难脱离潜在的AD病理的作用。FDG- PET has revealed a pattern of temporal- parietal and hippocampal hypometabolism that precedes volume loss in the same regions and is highly characteristic of AD. FDG- PET could be particularly useful after Aβ - PET imaging in those with elevated Aβ for staging, short- term prediction, to differentiate between AD variants and in persons without elevated Aβ on PET scans for the diagnosis of non- AD disorders. The degree and regional extent of hypometabolism measured by FDG- PET roughly correlates with the overall severity of cognitive impairment in AD, supporting the use of clinical severity as a proxy of AD pathology.  *FDG-PET揭示了颞顶叶和海马代谢不足的模式，该模式先于相同区域的体积损失，并且是AD的高度特征*。对于a β 升高的患者，fdg-pet成像后特别有用，用于分期，短期预测，以区分AD变体以及在PET扫描中没有a β 升高的患者，以诊断非AD疾病。通过fdg-pet测量的低代谢的程度和区域范围与AD认知障碍的总体严重程度大致相关，支持使用临床严重程度作为AD病理的代表。The development of Aβ - PET markers that allow the direct visualization of Aβ plaque accumulation has increased the precision of AD diagnosis and has enabled a real- time view of the evolution of β - amyloidosis over time. Many different Aβ - PET tracers have been developed194 and they have been validated against neuropathology(Fig. 7) . Three tracers — florbetapir, florbetaben or flutemetamol — have received FDA and EMA approval and are commercially available. In addition, the 11 C tracer Pittsburgh compound B has been widely used in research settings. All these tracers measure fibrillar Aβ deposits and give very similar results in clinical practice. International efforts led to the development of a standardized procedure and a common ‘Centiloid’ scale for Aβ - PET tracers. Aβ - PET and CSF Aβ 42 are closely but inversely correlated . Changes in CSF Aβ 42 may precede elevations in Aβ - PET, perhaps because PET cannot detect Aβ species such as oligomers or diffuse plaque Aβ .  能够直接观察a β 斑块积累的a β-PET标记的开发提高了AD诊断的准确性，并能够实时观察 β-淀粉样变的演变。已经开发了许多不同的a β-PET示踪剂，并且已经针对神经病理学进行了验证 (图。7)。三种示踪剂-florbetapir，florbetaben或flutemetamol-已获得FDA和EMA的批准，并且可以在市场上买到。此外，$^11$C 示踪剂匹兹堡化合物B已广泛用于研究环境。所有这些示踪剂测量纤维状a β 沉积物，并在临床实践中给出非常相似的结果。国际努力导致了a β-PET示踪剂的标准化程序和通用的 “厘泊” 量表的发展。A β-PET和CSF a β 42密切相关，但呈负相关。CSF a β 42的变化可能在a β-PET升高之前发生，这可能是因为PET无法检测到a β 物种，例如低聚物或弥漫性斑块a β。

**Quantitative Aβ-PET** imaging provides evidence on the extent and location of amyloid deposition, which is its main advantage over CSF-Aβ biomarkers. Although the pattern observed on Aβ-PET does not differ across AD subtypes or clinical phenotypes, it allows the stag- ing and monitoring of Aβ accumulation and the detection of Aβ in the earliest stages of AD. Longitudinal Aβ-PET studies demonstrate a very low rate of accumulation of Aβ, with a lag time of 10–20 years between initiation of accumulation and symptomatic cognitive impairment and a deceleration of Aβ accumulation coinciding with the onset of symptomatic disease. Approximately 20% of persons at 65 years of age and nearly 60% at 85 years have elevated brain Aβ but are cognitively normal. This demonstrates both the strong effect of age on brain Aβ accumulation and the lack of clinical consequences of elevated Aβ until something else happens, namely the expansion of tauopathy outside of the medial temporal lobe.

Appropriate **use criteria** have been developed to identify patients most likely to benefit from Aβ-PET for diagnosis. Aβ-PET imaging is not necessary for many patients with clinically diagnosed dementia due to AD; however, there is evidence for clinical utility in some symptomatic individuals not fulfilling these criteria. With the introduction of tau-PET into clinical research, the Aβ-PET appropriate use criteria need to be revised along with the development of similar criteria for tau-PET.

Several **tau-PET ligands** have been developed, of which 18F-flortaucipir has been approved by the FDA. Second-generation tracers with an improved signal- to-noise ratio as well as less off-target and lower non-specific binding are available for research purposes. Tau-PET imaging allows the detection of tauopathy that is largely, though not entirely, specific for AD. The tau-PET binding topography strongly correlates with cognitive performance and its regional patterns map onto the different AD clinical phenotypes (Fig. 8). There is a close correspondence between the regional accumulation of a tau-PET tracer and FDG hypometabolism. Tau-PET abnormalities are highly predictive of subsequent cognitive decline in both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals and sensitive to the regional extension of tauopathy over time. Whereas Aβ begins to accumulate 10–20 years prior to cognitive symptoms and then shows a reduced rate of accumulation around the time of symptom onset, tau accumulates in the temporal and parietal isocortex at a time much more proximate to cognitive impairment and continues to accumulate in parallel with disease progression. It is very uncommon to encounter a patient with substantial tau accumulation outside of the medial temporal lobe who does not have cognitive impairment.

#### CSF Biomarkers
The most validated and widely accepted CSF biomarkers for AD are **decreases in Aβ42** (or Aβ42 normalized to Aβ40 or total tau (t-tau)) and **increases** in phosphorylated tau (**p-tau181**). These biomarkers are recognized by research guidelines for their diagnostic utility and are used clinically in many European countries and the USA. Collaborative efforts over the last few years have sought to advance standardization and to improve the technology for CSF analysis.

Aβ42 is reduced in CSF in individuals with symptomatic AD of any severity and in asymptomatic persons who later develop symptoms. However, there is individual variability in Aβ42 levels in CSF and normalization using CSF Aβ40 or p-tau levels has shown better diagnostic performance compared with Aβ42 alone.

In the A-T-N scheme, p-tau181 is considered a specific biomarker for tau pathology, whereas t-tau is considered a general marker of neurodegeneration. Both p-tau181 and t-tau are typically increased in MCI and dementia due to AD. Both CSF p-tau181 and t-tau are of little value in the staging of disease severity. Neuropathological studies have shown that p-tau181 correlates only moderately with neurofibrillary tangles. p-Tau181 strongly correlates with t-tau in CSF and is markedly increased in AD but not in most other neurodegenerative diseases, supporting the use of p-tau181 as an AD-specific biomarker. p-Tau217 has recently been proposed as a more sensitive alternative to p-tau181; p-tau217 is not yet available for clinical practice.

New CSF biomarkers need to be incorporated into a diagnostic or prognostic framework for AD. CSF neurofilament light chain will likely emerge as an accepted biomarker for neurodegeneration of diverse aetiologies, and other CSF biomarkers on the verge of acceptance include neurogranin, synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1), although their specificities for AD are yet to be established. Biomarkers for non-AD processes, such as cerebrovascular pathology, α-synuclein and TDP43, will also be of value in establishing diagnostic frameworks for other neurodegenerative disorders and in recognizing co-occurrence in persons with abnormal AD biomarkers.

#### Blood based biomarkers
Blood-based biomarkers for AD are rapidly expanding, although effect sizes and other statistics to distinguish AD or MCI from controls are lower than those for CSF biomarkers (https:// www.alzforum.org/alzbiomarker) and more studies are needed to fully understand the links with more validated CSF and PET biomarkers. The development of blood- based biomarkers for Aβ42, p-tau181, p-tau217 and neurofilament light chain will greatly expand the capability with which AD as an aetiology can be included or excluded. One blood-based assay assessing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was approved in the USA and in the European Union in 2020 based on a mass spectroscopy assay. This assay closely correlates with Aβ-PET status, with an area under the curve value of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82–0.93)230. Blood-based biomarkers should still be considered as candidate screening tools and not as diagnostic biomarkers.

#### Prognosis and rate of progression

Both routine clinical practice and clinical trial experience has shown that the rate of cognitive progression in persons with AD is highly variable. Variability in the rate of progression may be due to the biology of AD, the involvement of non-AD pathologies or the presence of comorbidities. Age may not be particularly relevant after accounting for comorbidities and life expectancy. In general, patients with milder degrees of cognitive impairment experience a more gradual decline than those with more advanced impairment but, once the severe stages are reached, an apparent plateau may occur.

Although persons with subjective cognitive com- plaints without objective evidence of cognitive decline have a highly variable prognosis, having subjective cognitive complaints approximately doubles the risk of developing MCI. In one study with long-term follow-up, the transition from subjective memory complaint to MCI took an average of 9.4 years. In addition, subjective cognitive complaints are associated with higher burdens of imaging changes such as elevated Aβ on PET or hippocampal atrophy associated with AD. Similar to subjective cognitive impairment, clinically diagnosed MCI is associated with a substantially higher risk for progression to dementia than no cognitive impairment within 2 years. Of note, the risk of progression of MCI is highly variable, even in the more rigorous clinical trial setting. Some of the risk is predicted by the presence or absence of abnormal AD biomarkers.

Individuals with abnormal Aβ biomarkers who are either cognitively unimpaired or who have MCI are at increased risk for cognitive decline compared with persons with normal Aβ biomarker levels, especially if they also have an abnormal neurodegeneration biomarker, an abnormal tau-PET biomarker or elevated CSF tau levels. For example, 6 years after a CSF profile with both abnormal Aβ and tau, ~80% of cognitively normal individuals had developed MCI or dementia (HR 33.8; 95% CI 6.1–187). In individuals with MCI, those with elevated Aβ by PET have an increased risk of progression to dementia (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3–5.3). APOE genotypes are also associated with the risk of progression, either slowing in those with the APOE ε2 allele or accelerating in those with the APOE ε4 allele. In individuals with dominantly inherited AD, CSF tau species at different phosphorylation states are associated with different stages of disease.


==A high Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in blood samples is generally considered to be indicative of a lower risk for Alzheimer's disease==

**Elevated levels of β-amyloid 40 or 42 in blood samples may be indicative of increased risk for Alzheimer's disease**

- Gap
	- Understanding factors predicting MCI before functional limitations arise is essential for recognizing ADRD's origin and determining high-risk individuals.
	- The impact of genetic predispositions for AD, PTSD, educational achievement, or their combination on cognitive impairment in trauma-exposed groups remains ambiguous
- Objective
	- understand if genome-wide risks for AD, educational achievement, PTSD, or their combination predict cognitive impairment among WTC responders.
- Method
	- 3,997 WTC responders treated at two clinics managed by Stony Brook University.
	- **Variables of Interest:**
		- **Demographics:** Age during 9/11, biological sex, educational attainment.
		- **WTC Exposure:** Duration (weeks at WTC site) and type of work (risk-level based on exposure to toxins and trauma). The study also considered supervisory or volunteer roles during the efforts.
		- **PTSD Symptoms:** Measured using trauma-specific PTSD checklist (PCL-17) for the 9/11 WTC attacks. High internal consistency was observed.
	- **Genetic Data & Polygenic Scores:**
		- Blood samples collected from January 2012 to January 2019. DNA genotyped using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Imputed to over 25 million SNPs. Polygenic scores calculated for educational attainment, AD, PTSD, and re-experiencing PTSD symptoms. Scores represent the cumulative effect of SNPs associated with a phenotype, weighted by their GWAS effect sizes.
	- **Data Analytic Procedures:**
		- Data imported and analyzed in R Studio using "survival" and "survminer" packages.
		- *Descriptive statistics followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses* to gauge cumulative incidence of cognitive impairments.
		- Cox proportional hazard models estimated to understand effects of demographics, polygenic scores, and WTC exposure characteristics.
		- Population structure adjusted for by including the first twenty genetic principal components.
		- All continuous variables standardized before model estimations.
		- Sensitivity analysis executed to verify the consistency of effect estimations across different analytic methods.
- Results
	- ![[Pasted image 20231031145635.png|500]] 
	- **Exposure Severity**:
		- *Exposure based on probable contact with airborne toxins* was significantly associated with cognitive impairments, both mild and severe.
		- However, exposure to traumatic sights like blood and bodily fluids was not linked with cognitive impairments.
	- **Genetic Liability for AD**:
		- While there was a *significant link between the polygenic score for AD and MCI*, it was only marginally associated with severe impairment.
		- The reason might be the relatively younger age of the WTC responders; symptoms of AD typically appear later in life.
	- **Limitations**:
		- **Third-Variable Confounding**: The potential influence of unmeasured variables can introduce bias in the effect sizes, which is a typical limitation in non-experimental studies. As such, making definitive causal conclusions from the study's findings would be inappropriate.
		- **Lack of Control Group**: The study lacks a genuine control group since all WTC responders experienced some degree of trauma. This absence makes it challenging to understand the true effect sizes.
		- **Demographic Differences**: WTC responders and residents of the NYC metropolitan area differ demographically from the broader U.S. population. Most notably, many WTC responders were white males, introducing potential bias.
- Conclusion: Age, *type of work at the WTC sites*, and PTSD symptoms were recurrent significant predictors for cognitive impairments.

	1. WTC dust exposures
		1. On 9/11/2001, an unprecedented number of residents of, and workers in New York City were acutely dosed with a severe pulmonary exposure to dust from the collapsed World Trade Center, located on Manhattan’s lower West Side. Individuals caught in the dust cloud were exposed to a vast array of inhaled exposures, lodging PMs in both their lungs and gut. There has been substantial documentation of PM exposures arising from the dust cloud originating from the initial collapse of the towers, and subsequently, on the **settled dust** – predominantly, the **re-aerosolized PM** in the weeks and months that followed. However, as we will emphasize, this second and more enduring exposure may have been a more potent and detrimental neurological exposure, as the longer-term inhalation of specific subtypes of PM are more likely to cause systemic changes consistent with neurodegenerative disease. However, this is more challenging to measure since it is both temporally distant from the WTC events and is also less likely to be identified and reported by unbeknownst responders, as the inhaled dust is miniscule. 2001 年 9 月 11 日，纽约市空前数量的居民和工人因严重吸入位于曼哈顿下西区倒塌的世界贸易中心的灰尘而严重中毒。 陷入尘埃云中的个体暴露于大量的吸入暴露中，将颗粒物沉积在他们的肺部和肠道中。 有大量文件记录了塔楼最初倒塌产生的尘埃云以及随后的沉降灰尘（主要是随后几周和几个月内重新雾化的颗粒物）引起的颗粒物暴露。 然而，正如我们将强调的那样，第二次更持久的接触可能是一种更有效和更有害的神经学接触，因为长期吸入特定亚型的 PM 更有可能引起与神经退行性疾病一致的全身变化。 然而，测量这一点更具挑战性，因为它在时间上与世贸中心事件相距甚远，而且由于吸入的灰尘很小，不太可能被不知名的响应者识别和报告。
		3. Reviewing WTC air quality studies does, however, help us to better understand the nature of these exposures. For example, in the days and weeks following 9/11/2001, Lioy et al., collected and analyzed dust from sites along three streets near the WTC and while suggesting that more than 95% of the dust were >PM10, they also reported that ~1.5% of the dust was made up of PM10 and that significant amounts of PAHs were detected from dust measured across all three measurement sites. Further detectable elements in dust at all three sites identified nearest the WTC included strontium锶, barium钡, lead, aluminum, thallium,  and manganese锰, among others. Interrogating this further, Landrigan, Lioy, et al. then noted that airborne exposures to PM2.5 were elevated in sites surrounding the WTC for more than six weeks following the WTC disaster, while also noting that PAH exposures near the WTC site was heaviest in the week after the 9/11/2001 event and remained as much as ~12 times higher in the following month. However, high PM10, PM2.5 and PAH exposures lasted well into January 2002 as the only remaining inhaled exposures, as many of the coarser materials had settled and may have been removed 然而，回顾世贸中心空气质量研究确实有助于我们更好地了解这些暴露的性质。 例如，在 2001 年 9 月 11 日之后的几天和几周内，Lioy 等人收集并分析了世贸中心附近 3 条街道沿线的灰尘，虽然表明*超过 95% 的灰尘>PM10*，但他们还报告说 约 *1.5% 的灰尘由 PM10* 组成，并且从所有三个测量地点测量的灰尘中检测到大量 PAH。 在距离世贸中心最近的所有三个地点的灰尘中，进一步检测到的元素包括锶、钡动力学、铅、铝、铊和锰等。 Landrigan、Lioy 等人进一步探讨了这一点。 随后指出，在世贸中心灾难发生后六周多的时间里，世贸中心周围地点空气中 PM2.5 的暴露量一直在升高，同时还指出，2001 年 9 月 11 日事件发生后的一周内，世贸中心地点附近的 PAH 暴露量最高，并且 在接下来的一个月里，这一数字仍然高达约 12 倍。 然而，PM10、PM2.5 和 PAH 的高暴露量一直持续到 2002 年 1 月，作为唯一剩余的吸入暴露，因为许多较粗的材料已经沉淀并可能已被清除。

	2. Air pollution definition
		1.  a complex mixture of excess solid, liquid and gaseous pollutants, of which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified six ‘criteria’ chemicals: Carbon Monoxide, Lead, Nitrogen Oxides, Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide and Particulate Matter (PM), the latter of which is borne from four aerodynamic diameters: coarse (PM10; <10μm), fine (PM2.5; <2.5μm), ultra-fine (UFPM<0.1μm) and nanoparticles (nPM<50nm). Other air pollutants include, but are not limited to Acrolein丙烯醛, Asbestos, Benzene苯, Carbon Disulfide二硫化碳, Creosote杂酚油, Fuels Oils/Kerosene燃料油/煤油, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)多环芳烃, Synthetic Vitreous Fibers合成玻璃纤维, Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs)总石油烃. These airborne pollutants can affect anyone. While researchers in government agencies, health organizations, and private industry strive to find ways to reduce anthropogenic pollution in accordance with to EPA and other global regulatory standards, these chemicals are likely to linger in our atmosphere for extended and chronic periods of time, rendering their study both timely and of paramount importance for understanding the impact on human and animal health. 空气污染是指过量的固体，液体和气体污染物的复杂混合物，美国环境保护署 (EPA) 已确定六种 “标准” 化学品: 一氧化碳，铅，氮氧化物，臭氧，二氧化硫和颗粒物 (PM)，后者由四个空气动力学直径构成: 粗 (PM10; &lt;10μm) 、细 (PM2.5; &lt;2.5 μ m) 、超细 (UFPM&lt;0.1 μ m) 和纳米颗粒 (nPM&lt;50nm)。其他空气污染物包括但不限于丙烯醛、石棉、苯、二硫化碳、杂酚油、燃料油/煤油、多环芳烃 (pah) 、合成玻璃纤维、总石油烃 (tph)。这些空气中的污染物会影响任何人。虽然政府机构，卫生组织和私营企业的研究人员努力根据EPA和其他全球监管标准寻找减少人为污染的方法，但这些化学物质可能会在我们的大气中长期存在，使他们的研究既及时又对理解对人类和动物健康的影响至关重要。
	3. emerging evidence show that *chronic and acute exposures to PM* are associated with neurodevelopment disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as ADRD. 
		1. Moreover, the underlying etiological mechanisms for these observations is not only the result of direct inhalations of PM2.5 and UFPM in the brain via pulmonary and olfactory entrance, but also indirectly to the brain from their uptake in peripheral systems, which can induce neuroinflammatory and oxidative stressors that are subsequently neurotoxic to the CNS, resulting in neurocognitive decline.此外，这些观察结果的潜在病因学机制不仅是PM2.5和UFPM通过肺部和嗅觉入口直接吸入大脑的结果，而且还通过外周系统的摄取间接进入大脑，从而诱发神经炎症和炎症。 氧化应激源随后对中枢神经系统产生神经毒性，导致神经认知能力下降。
	4. PM2.5
		1. Analyses of global variations in the chemical composition of PM2.5 revealed that the majority of anthropogenic contributions include approximately 20% ammoniated sulfate, ~13% crustal material, ~12% black carbon, ~5% ammonium nitrate, ~1% trace element oxides and ~40% residual matter. According to the EPA, these atmospheric aerosols are mostly formed as secondary particles in the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels from power plants, industrial facilities, mobile and other sources of combustion 对PM2.5化学成分的全球变化的分析表明，大多数人为贡献包括大约20% 的氨化硫酸盐，13% 地壳物质，12% 黑碳，5% 硝酸铵，1% 微量元素氧化物和40% 残留物质。根据EPA的说法，这些大气气溶胶主要是由于发电厂，工业设施，移动和其他燃烧源的化石燃料燃烧而在大气中形成的二次颗粒
		2. The detrimental cognitive effects of chronic PM2.5 exposures received early and detailed attention from a provincial group of scientists in Mexico City, who demonstrated associations with a diversity of neuropathologies such as white matter glial apoptosis, disruptions in the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), oxidative stress, neurovascularization and neuroinflammation, along with evidence of A, T and N in canines, children and young adults. Furthermore, a large prospective community study of non-demented older women (aged 71–89 years old), demonstrated that higher PM2.5 exposures displayed significant reductions in white matter, with effects reported in the frontal and temporal cortex and the corpus calloscum, which the authors stated was equivalent to 1 to 2 years of brain aging. A German cross-sectional study of 50–80 year-olds demonstrated that PM2.5 exposures are positively associated with higher aMCI. This likely reflects prodromal AD with structural MRI changes showing associations with volumetric decreases in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, precuneus and the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus. Moreover, a large U.S. study of older adults (55+ years old) exposed to high levels of PM2.5 demonstrated a 1.5 times higher error rate in cognitive domains of working memory and orientation and another large population study (mean age 60.5 years old) in Los Angeles revealed that increasing PM2.5 exposures were associated with lower verbal learning. Similarly, a large study of Great London residents (mean age 66) displayed that higher PM2.5 exposures associated with longitudinal decline in standardized memory scores and a prospective study of community dwelling seniors in Boston demonstrated that residential proximity to major roadways was associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests of verbal learning and memory, psychomotor speed, language and executive functioning - though important to note is that this latter study did not distinguish PM subtype exposures. Additionally, a prospective cohort study of primary school children  (mean age 8.5) from 39 schools in Barcelona revealed that traffic-related PM2.5 was associated with reductions in cognitive growth equivalent to 22% of the annual change in working memory, 30% of the annual change in superior working memory, and 11% of the annual change in the inattentiveness scale. It concluded that traffic was the only source of fine particles associated with a reduction in cognitive development. 慢性PM2.5暴露的有害认知影响得到了墨西哥城一个省级科学家小组的早期和详细关注，他们证明了*与多种神经病理有关*，例如白质神*经胶质细胞凋亡，血脑屏障 (BBB) 破坏，氧化应激，神经血管化和神经炎症*，以及犬科动物，儿童和年轻人中A，T和N的证据。此外，一项针对非痴呆老年妇女 (71-89岁) 的大型前瞻性社区研究表明，较高的PM2.5暴露显示白质显着减少，并在额叶和颞叶皮层和call体中报告了影响，作者指出，这相当于1至2年的大脑衰老。一项针对50-80岁人群的德国横断面研究表明，PM2.5暴露与较高的aMCI呈正相关。这可能反映了前驱性AD，其结构MRI变化显示与海马，内嗅皮层，杏仁核，梭状回，前神经和扣带回峡部的体积减少有关。此外，美国一项针对暴露于高水平PM2.5的老年人 (55岁以上) 的大型研究表明，工作记忆和取向的认知领域的错误率高出1.5倍，另一项大型人口研究 (平均年龄60.5岁) 在洛杉矶显示，PM2.5暴露与较低的语言学习。同样，，一项对大伦敦居民 (平均年龄66岁) 的大型研究显示，更高的PM2.5暴露与标准化记忆得分的纵向下降相关，一项对波士顿社区居住老年人的前瞻性研究表明，靠近主要道路的住宅与言语学习和记忆的认知测试的较差表现有关，精神运动速度，语言和执行功能 -尽管需要注意的是，后一项研究并未区分PM亚型暴露。此外，一项对巴塞罗那39所学校的小学生 (平均年龄8.5岁) 进行的前瞻性队列研究显示，与交通相关的PM2.5与认知增长的减少有关，相当于工作记忆的年度变化的22%，30% 工作记忆的年度变化。并11% 了不专心量表的年度变化。结论是交通是与认知发展减少相关的唯一细颗粒来源
		3. PM2.5 can more readily enter the brain by penetrating through the olfactory epithelium and can then travel deep into the airways and lungs, infiltrating blood circulation and ultimately crossing the BBB, which can induce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity through transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel pathways. To better understand underlying molecular mechanisms for these phenomena, animal studies working with onemonth old male mice exposed to concentrated PM2.5 for six hours. The mice demonstrated a higher latency in locating the escape hole and a higher number of location errors in a Barnes maze task, along with depressive-like responses and impairments in spatial learning and memory, which were attributed to decreased apical dendritic spine density and dendritic branching in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, respectively. Developmental studies with Wistar male rats exposed to PM2.5 who were assessed for short term memory performance using spontaneous nonmatching to sample recognition tests analogous to novel object recognition, demonstrated significant reductions in discrimination and less exploration time of novel objects after 150 days of exposure. The authors identified a potential underlying mechanism being cortical oxidative stressors, as they reported increases in Malondialdehyde (MDA). Using adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (2 months old), it was demonstrated that intra-tracheal injection of PM2.5 for up to a year damaged sensory functions as well as learning and memory as a function of ultrastructural changes in mitochondria and neuronal myelin sheaths, along with abnormal expression of apoptosisrelated proteins (Caspase-3, Caspase-9). Studies with male C57BL/6 mice subjected to concentrated PM2.5 inhalations demonstrated that after nine months of exposure, there was a significant increase in beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE) protein levels, APP processing, and Aβ40 levels, lending credence to the A component of the ATN model for ADRD. Furthermore, these molecular changes correlated with a concomitant increase in Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 protein levels, changes in the cytokine profile and synaptic alterations as a function of increased postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expressions sans presynaptic protein synaptophysin. The authors argue that prolonged exposures to PM2.5 has the potential to alter mechanisms of neuroinflammations and promote development of early AD-like pathology. PM2.5可以通过穿透嗅觉上皮更容易进入大脑，然后可以深入气道和肺部，浸润血液循环并最终穿过BBB，这可以通过瞬时受体电位melastatin 2 (TRPM2) 通道途径诱导氧化应激和神经毒性。为了更好地了解这些现象的*潜在分子机制*，动物研究与暴露于浓缩PM2.5 6小时的单月龄雄性小鼠一起工作。小鼠在Barnes迷宫任务中显示出更高的潜伏期和更高数量的定位错误，以及类似*抑郁*的反应以及*空间学习和记忆的障碍*，这归因于顶树突状脊柱密度和树突状分支的减少在海马CA1和CA3区域，分别对暴露于PM2.5的Wistar雄性大鼠进行的发育研究表明，暴露于PM2.5的Wistar雄性大鼠使用与新物体识别类似的自发不匹配的样本识别测试来评估短期记忆表现，结果表明暴露150天后，新物体的辨别能力显著降低，探索时间更短。作者发现了潜在的潜在机制是皮质氧化应激，因为他们报告了丙二醛 (MDA) 的增加。使用成年Sprague-Dawley雄性大鼠 (2个月大)，证明气管内注射PM2.5长达一年会损害感觉功能以及学习和记忆，这是线粒体和神经元髓鞘超微结构变化的功能，以及凋亡相关蛋白的异常表达 (Caspase-3，caspase-9)。对雄性C57BL/6小鼠进行浓缩PM2.5吸入的研究表明，暴露9个月后，β 位点淀粉样前体蛋白 (APP) 裂解酶 (BACE) 蛋白水平，APP处理和Aβ40水平显着增加，为ADRD的ATN模型的A组件提供了信任。此外，这些分子变化与Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) 和COX-2蛋白水平的伴随增加，细胞因子谱的变化以及突触改变与突触后密度蛋白95 (PSD95) 表达的增加无关突触前蛋白突触素。作者认为，长时间暴露于PM2.5有可能改变神经炎症的机制并促进早期AD样病理的发展。Further molecular mechanistic insights come from studies with human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells. It was demonstrated that 24-hour exposures to PM2.5 led to changes in mitochondrial dynamics such as swelling, the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and decreases in Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) levels, mitochondrial membrane potentials, DNA copy numbers, fission/fusion genes (Drp1 and OPA1), which affected the gene expression of CypD, SIRT3 and COX Ⅳ. Furthermore, the authors reported increases in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and Aβ42 levels and inhibition of manganese-superoxide dismutase (SOD2) activities, reduction of GSH levels GSH/GSSG ratio and elevation of mitochondrial MDA contents. The authors argue that such mitochondrial dysfunctions and generation of oxidative stressors are some of the  major underlying molecular mechanisms for PM2.5 induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, there is a plethora of evidence that link PM2.5 exposures to neurocognitive decline, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity and ADRD-like neuropathology. 进一步的分子机制见解来自对人类神经母细胞瘤SHSY5Y细胞的研究。已证明，暴露于PM2.5的24小时会导致*线粒体动力学*发生变化，例如肿胀，线粒体通透性转换孔 (mPTP) 的打开以及三磷酸腺苷 (ATP) 水平，线粒体膜电位，DNA拷贝数，裂变/融合基因 (Drp1和OPA1)，影响CypD，SIRT3和COX Ⅳ 的基因表达。此外，作者报道了细胞活性氧 (ROS)，Ca2和Aβ42水平的增加以及锰超氧化物歧化酶 (SOD2) 活性的抑制，GSH水平的降低GSH/GSSG比率的升高以及线粒体MDA含量的升高。作者认为，这种线粒体功能障碍和氧化应激源的产生是PM2.5诱导神经毒性的一些主要潜在分子机制。综合起来，有大量证据表明PM2.5暴露与神经认知下降，神经炎症，神经毒性和ADRD样神经病理学有关。
	5.  Ultra Fine Particulate Matter (UFPM)
		1. Diesel emissions are a major component of UFPM exposures and are the product of internal combustion exhausts and are a known carcinogen, with chemical contents belonging mostly to the size category of UFPM. Diesel inhalations have been demonstrated to cause elevations in interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitrated proteins, and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) – a microglial marker. These changes promote neuroinflammation and increases in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), IL-1β, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), fractalkine, and the IBA-1 microglial marker in multiple brain regions, along with increased microglial IBA-1 staining in the substantia nigra, and finally, global elevations in TNFα. These observations highlight complex, interacting mechanisms for how diesel exposures, and to a wider extent UFPM exposures, may cause neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Similarly, acute diesel exposures in C57BL/6 mice significantly increased lipid peroxidation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-α) in various brain regions, in particular, the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. In addition, the authors reported these changes in collocated regions such as the entorhinal cortex, along with activated microglia as a function of increased expressions in ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and translocator protein TSPO binding. This lends further evidence in support of the hypothesis that diesel exposures are neuroinflammatory, generate oxidative stress and ultimately lead to neurotoxicity in the brain *柴油排放是UFPM暴露的主要组成部分*，是内燃废气的产物，是已知的致癌物，化学成分主要属于UFPM的大小类别。柴油吸入已被证明会导致interleukin-6 (IL-6)，硝化蛋白和离子化的钙结合衔接子分子1 (IBA-1) -小胶质细胞标记物的升高。这些变化促进神经炎症，并增加肿瘤坏死因子-α (tnf α)，IL-1β，IL-6，晚期糖基化终产物 (RAGE)，fractalkine和IBA-1小胶质细胞标志物的巨噬细胞炎性蛋白-1α (MIP-1α) 受体在多个脑区域中，以及黑质中增加的小胶质细胞IBA-1染色，最后是tnf α 的全球海拔。这些观察结果强调了柴油暴露以及更广泛的UFPM暴露如何引起神经炎症和神经毒性的复杂的相互作用机制。同样，C57BL/6小鼠的急性柴油暴露显着增加了各种大脑区域 (尤其是嗅球和海马) 中促炎性细胞因子 (IL-1α，IL-1β，IL-3，IL-6，TNF-α) 的脂质过氧化。此外，作者报告了这些在诸如内嗅皮层的并置区域中的变化，以及活化的小胶质细胞，这是离子化钙结合适配器分子1 (Iba1) 和转运蛋白TSPO结合中表达增加的函数。这提供了进一步的证据来支持以下假设: 柴油暴露是神经炎性的，会产生氧化应激并最终导致大脑中的神经毒性
	6. nano-Particulate Matter (nPM)
		1. nPM includes the smallest of particles, sizing in at 1–200nm, which requires the use of electron microscopy to visualize them, as they are too small for ordinary optical microscopes. Being so small, nPM can most readily enter the body through pulmonary systems, translocating beyond the lungs to the both the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, simultaneously entering blood circulation, leading to inflammation and oxidative stress to other organs. Inhaled nPM can enter the CNS through olfactory pathways, highlighting a severe exposure route to neurotoxic effects. To further highlight this exposure route, animal studies with adult mice exposed to re-aerosolized nPM for 5, 20, and 45 cumulative hours over 3 weeks, demonstrated rapid increases of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) protein in the olfactory neuroepithelium (OE) and the olfactory bulb (OB), with all brain regions demonstrating increased levels of TNFα protein by 45 hours. In addition, the mice demonstrated earlier induction of TNFα mRNA in OE and OB, corresponding with mixed glial responses in in-vitro OE, with rapid induction of nitrite and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), followed by induction of TNFα, signifying oxidative stress and inflammatory responses to nPM between the OE and the brain nPM包括最小的颗粒，尺寸为1-200nm，这需要使用电子显微镜来可视化它们，因为它们对于普通的光学显微镜来说太小了。由于nPM很小，最容易通过肺部系统进入人体，从肺部转移到心血管和中枢神经系统，同时进入血液循环，导致炎症和氧化应激到其他器官。吸入的nPM可以通过嗅觉途径进入CNS，突出了神经毒性作用的严重暴露途径。为了进一步强调这种暴露途径，对成年小鼠在3周内暴露于重新雾化nPM 5、20和45个累积小时的动物研究表明，*嗅觉神经上皮 (OE) 和嗅球 (OB)* 中的4-羟基-2-壬烯 (4HNE) 和3-硝基酪氨酸 (3-NT) 蛋白迅速增加，所有大脑区域均显示tnf α 蛋白水平升高45小时。此外，小鼠在OE和OB中表现出较早的tnf α mRNA诱导，与体外OE中的混合神经胶质反应相对应，快速诱导亚硝酸盐和诱导型一氧化氮合酶 (iNOS)，然后诱导*tnf α*，OE与大脑之间对nPM的氧化应激和炎症反应的意义
		2. Animal studies examining neuritic atrophy, white matter degeneration, and microglial activation in the hippocampus of young and middle-aged C57BL/6J mice exposed to nPM, demonstrated that young mice showed selective changes in the CA1 region such neurite atrophy, decreased white matter myelin basic proteins (MBP) and Glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) proteins, and increased Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and TNFa mRNA. However, the authors reported diminished effects of nPM exposures in older mice, suggesting an age ceiling effect, and further argued that the selective vulnerability of the CA1 of young mice parallels the observed CA1 vulnerability in AD. Likewise, recent work further interrogating this model has noted that exposures to nPM additionally excited an amyloidogenic response by increasing oxidative damage to the lipid rafts and altering APP processing, with one interpretation of these results being that such exposures might cause an Alzheimer’s-like dysfunction, resulting, in part, from over-production of AB that may be unique to exposure-related diseases. Furthermore, examinations of female EFAD transgenic mice (5xFAD+/−/human APOE-ε3 or ε4+/+) with 225 hours of nPM exposure over a period of 15 weeks demonstrated increased cerebral Aβ deposits, Aβ oligomers, selective atrophy of hippocampal CA1 neurites and decreased GluR1, whereas female wildtype counterparts also showed nPM-induced CA1 atrophy and GluR1 decrease, with in-vitro nPM exposures in neuroblastoma cells (N2a-APP/swe) demonstrating increased pro-amyloidogenic processing of APP. This suggests that nPM exposures promote pathological brain aging with potentially a greater impact in APOE-ε4. These findings lend support to the notion that nPM exposures contribute to the A component of the ATN model for ADRD. 动物研究检查暴露于nPM的年轻和中年C57BL/6J小鼠海马中的神经性萎缩，白质变性和小胶质细胞激活，表明年轻小鼠在CA1区域表现出选择性变化，例如神经突萎缩，白质髓鞘碱性蛋白 (MBP) 和谷氨酸受体1 (GluR1) 蛋白减少，离子钙结合衔接子分子1 (Iba1) 和TNFa mRNA增加。然而，作者报告了nPM暴露对老年小鼠的影响减弱，表明年龄上限效应，并进一步认为年轻小鼠CA1的选择性脆弱性与AD中观察到的CA1脆弱性相似。同样，最近对该模型进行进一步研究的工作指出，暴露于nPM还通过增加对脂质筏的氧化损伤和改变APP处理来激发淀粉样蛋白生成反应，对这些结果的一种解释是，这种暴露可能导致阿尔茨海默氏症样功能障碍，部分导致，由于AB的过度生产，这可能是与暴露相关的疾病所独有的。此外，在15周内对雌性EFAD转基因小鼠 (5xFAD/-/人APOE-ε3或 ε4 / ) 进行了225小时的nPM暴露检查，结果表明脑a β 沉积物增加，a β 寡聚体，海马CA1神经突选择性萎缩和GluR1减少，而女性野生型对应物也显示nPM诱导的CA1萎缩和GluR1减少，神经母细胞瘤细胞 (N2a-APP/swe) 中的体外nPM暴露表明APP的前淀粉样蛋白生成过程增加。这表明nPM暴露会促进病理性脑衰老，并可能对APOE-ε4产生更大的影响 。这些发现为nPM暴露有助于ADRD的ATN模型的A组成部分的观点提供了支持。
		3. Neuroinflammatory studies demonstrated that nPM exposure elevated in IL-1β, IL-3 IL-6, TNF-α and MDA in the hippocampus, and that such brain inflammation and oxidative stress were noticeably higher in male mice than in female mice, suggesting sex differences. A study examining glial TNFα production in mixed glia (astrocytes and microglia) derived from neonatal rat cerebral cortex, demonstrated that microglia contributed more to TNFα induction than astrocytes when exposed to nPM. Furthermore, nPM exposures in C57BL/6J male mice demonstrated reactive microglia and a two-fold increase in the local deposition of complement C5/ C5α proteins and complement component C5a receptor 1 (CD88) in the corpus callosum, which indicate that the interaction between such anaphylatoxins and activated microglia may play an important role in white matter injury following nPM exposure. A study evaluating three month old C57BL/6J male responses to chronic inhalations of reaerosolized nPM displayed altered neuronal and glial activities, insofar that GluA1 was decreased in the hippocampus, whereas glia were activated with the subsequent inductions of (IL-1α) and *tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)* inflammatory cytokines in cerebral cortex, with in-vitro hippocampal slice cultures showing that 24–48 hour nPM exposures increased the neurotoxicity of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) along with impaired neurite outgrowth in embryonic neuron cultures. The authors argued that nPM can affect embryonic and adult neurons through glutamatergic mechanisms, but also that cerebral ischemia, which involves glutamatergic excitotoxicity, could be exacerbated by nPM. Moreover, investigations of high dose nPM-rich diesel exhaust exposures in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory function-related gene expressions in BALB/c female mice for three months, displayed higher mRNA expression levels of the  NMDA receptor subunit NR2A, the proinflammatory cytokine CCL3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), along with a longer time to reach the hidden platform in the Morris water maze. In a follow up study, the authors demonstrated that the same high exposures to nPM diesel exposures disabled the mice from discriminating between familiar and novel object recognition, a decrease in the expression of glutamate transporter EAAT4 and an increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD65, along with prominent activation of microglia in the hippocampus, suggesting that genes related to glutamate metabolism may be involved in the nPM rich diesel exhaust exposure-induced neurotoxicity. Likewise, in a study using filter-eluted nPM sans PAHs, it was reported that in vivo exposure of adult male mice to re-aerosolized nPM for 3 weeks resulted in the induction of IFNγ and NF-κB and that gestational exposure to nPM caused equivalent depressive behaviors in the forced swim cognitive test, but the effect was greater on males than females. Taken together, using both in vitro cells cultures and in vivo rodents, there is evidence to suggest that nPM exposures initiate neuroinflammation and subsequent neurotoxicity via proinflammatory cytokines from microglia that contribute to neurocognitive decline and that may lead to the genesis of ADRD 神经炎症研究表明，海马中IL-1β，IL-3 IL-6，TNF-α 和MDA的nPM暴露升高，并且雄性小鼠的脑部炎症和氧化应激明显高于雌性小鼠，表明性别差异。一项研究研究了新生大鼠大脑皮层衍生的混合神经胶质 (星形胶质细胞和小胶质细胞) 中神经胶质tnf α 的产生，表明当暴露于nPM时，小胶质细胞比星形胶质细胞对tnf α 诱导的贡献更大。此外，C57BL/6J雄性小鼠的nPM暴露显示出反应性小胶质细胞，并且补体C5/ C5α 蛋白和补体成分C5a受体1 (CD88) 在call体中的局部沉积增加了两倍，这表明这种过敏毒素与活化的小胶质细胞之间的相互作用可能在nPM暴露后的白质损伤中起重要作用。一项评估三个月大的C57BL/6J男性对重新雾化的nPM的慢性吸入反应的研究显示出神经元和神经胶质活性的改变，因为海马中的GluA1降低，而神经胶质被激活，随后被 (IL-1α) 和肿瘤坏死因子激活-α (tnf α) 在大脑皮层中的炎性细胞因子，体外海马切片培养物显示24-48小时nPM暴露增加了N-甲基-d-天冬氨酸 (NMDA) 的神经毒性，并损害了胚胎神经元培养物中的神经突生长。作者认为，nPM可以通过谷氨酸能机制影响胚胎和成年神经元，但nPM也可能加剧涉及谷氨酸能兴奋性毒性的脑缺血。此外，对BALB/c雌性小鼠海马依赖性空间学习和记忆功能相关基因表达中高剂量富含nPM的柴油机尾气暴露进行了三个月的研究，显示NMDA受体亚基NR2A，促炎性细胞因子CCL3的mRNA表达水平较高，和脑源性神经营养因子 (BDNF)，随着更长的时间到达莫里斯水迷宫中的隐藏平台。在一项后续研究中，作者证明，相同的高暴露于nPM柴油暴露使小鼠无法区分熟悉的和新的对象识别，谷氨酸转运蛋白EAAT4表达的减少和谷氨酸脱羧酶GAD65的增加，以及海马小胶质细胞的显着活化，提示与谷氨酸代谢相关的基因可能参与nPM丰富的柴油机尾气暴露诱导的神经毒性。同样，在一项使用过滤洗脱的nPM sans PAHs的研究中，据报道，成年雄性小鼠体内暴露于重新雾化的nPM 3周会导致ifn γ 和NF-κ b的诱导，并且妊娠暴露于nPM在强迫游泳认知测试一下中引起同等的抑郁行为，但对男性的影响大于女性。总之，使用体外细胞培养物和体内啮齿动物，有证据表明nPM暴露通过小胶质细胞的促炎细胞因子引发神经炎症和随后的神经毒性，这些细胞因子会导致神经认知能力下降，并可能导致ADRD的发生
	7. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
		1. NO2 is a gaseous product of fossil fuel combustion, and the main source of nitrate aerosols, which form an important fraction of PM2.5. Examining a cohort of elderly women (mean age 74.1 years) living next to a busy road with more than 10,000 cars per day in Germany for over 20 years, Ranft, et al., reported that background concentrations of PM10 and trafficrelated PM were consistently associated with lower cognitive performance in a dosedependent manner. Specifically, for PM10 these studies reported that neurocognitive effects to NO2 exposures were strongly dependent on residential distance to the road, and displayed a distance-dependent drop in neuropsychological test scores. In two large cohort studies in the northern Manhattan area of New York City, an increase in NO2 exposures resulted in lower global cognitive scores at enrollment and more rapid decline in cognitive scores between visits, and together with similar observations from PM2.5 and PM10 exposures, the authors argued that exposures to air pollution has adverse effects on cognitive aging and brain health. Furthermore, NO2 exposures are associated with olfactory dysfunction, increase in ischemic stroke, reduced psychomotor development during childhood, depression, memory decline, cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), cortical thickness in AD signature regions (entorhinal, inferior and middle temporal, fusiform, posterior cingulate, precuneus and supramarginal gyri) and incidence of dementia. Additionally, animal studies have demonstrated that direct NO2 inhalation caused a worsening of spatial learning and memory and promoted dose-dependent Aβ deposition, while other studies have reported that direct NO2 inhalations promote proinflammatory mechanisms that originate from the periphery, which then translocate to the brain, excitotoxically disrupting synaptic plasticity mechanisms of learning and memory such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Finally, NO2 inhalations were shown to induce tauopathy by disturbing the insulin signaling pathway via p38 MAPK and/or JNK activation and IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3β attenuation. Taken together, there is strong evidence that chronic exposure to high levels  of anthropogenically released NO2 in the atmosphere can lead to the genesis of neurocognitive symptoms as a function of ATN that may lead to ADRD. NO2是化石燃料燃烧的气态产物，是硝酸盐气溶胶的主要来源，形成PM2.5的重要组成部分。Ranft等人研究了一组老年妇女 (平均年龄74.1岁)，该妇女居住在一条繁忙的道路旁，每天有10,000辆以上的汽车在德国超过20年，据报道，PM10的背景浓度和与交通相关的PM以剂量依赖的方式与较低的认知表现相关联。具体来说，对于PM10，这些研究报告说，对NO2暴露的神经认知作用在很大程度上取决于住宅到道路的距离，并且显示出神经心理学测试一下分数的距离依赖性下降。在纽约市曼哈顿北部地区的两项大型队列研究中，NO2暴露的增加导致入组时的全球认知得分降低，两次访问之间的认知得分下降更快，以及PM2.5和PM10暴露的类似观察结果，作者认为，暴露于空气污染对认知老化和大脑健康有不利影响。此外，NO2暴露与嗅觉功能障碍，缺血性中风增加，儿童时期精神运动发育减少，抑郁，记忆力下降，认知能力下降，遗忘型轻度认知障碍 (aMCI)，AD特征区域 (内嗅、下颞和中颞部、梭形、后扣带回、前突和上突回) 的皮质厚度 和痴呆的发生率。此外，动物研究表明，直接吸入NO2会导致空间学习和记忆的恶化，并促进剂量依赖性a β 沉积，而其他研究报道，直接吸入NO2会促进起源于周围的促炎机制，然后转移到大脑，兴奋性毒性破坏学习和记忆的突触可塑性机制，如长时程增强 (LTP)。最后，NO2吸入被证明通过p38 MAPK和/或JNK激活和IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3β 衰减干扰胰岛素信号通路而诱发tauopathy。总之，有强有力的证据表明，长期暴露于大气中高水平的人为释放的NO2会导致神经认知症状的发生，这是ATN的功能，可能导致ADRD。
	8. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
		1. PAHs are produced from the incomplete combustion of organic materials such as coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, tobacco and as part of diesel exhaust particulates, which then accumulate in our breathable atmosphere. In a sample of elderly Americans over 60 years of age, PAHs were shown to be negatively associated with working memory. Elderly adults notwithstanding, PAHs have been further demonstrated to be harmful to the developing fetal brain, longitudinally extending into childhood as revealed by a depressed verbal IQ measure. Moreover, prenatal exposures to PAHs contributed to slower processing speed, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, and externalizing problems in urban youth by dose-dependently disrupting the development of left hemispheric white matter, whereas postnatal exposures to PAHs contributed to additional disturbances in the development of white matter in bilateral dorsal prefrontal regions. Furthermore, studies investigating exposure to PAHs in New York city five-year-old children demonstrated an adverse drop in cognitive performance and suggested that they may play a role in childhood Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) behavior problems 多环芳烃是由有机材料 (例如煤，石油，天然气，木材，垃圾，烟草) 的不完全燃烧产生的，并作为柴油废气颗粒的一部分，然后积聚在我们的可呼吸大气中。在60岁以上的美国老年人样本中，PAHs与工作记忆呈负相关。尽管有老年人，但PAHs已被进一步证明对发育中的胎儿大脑有害，如抑郁的口头智商测量所揭示的那样，纵向延伸到儿童期。此外，产前暴露于PAHs会导致处理速度减慢，注意力缺陷/多动障碍症状以及通过剂量依赖性地干扰左半球白质的发展而使城市青年的外部化问题，而产后暴露于多环芳烃会导致双侧背侧前额叶区域白质发育的额外紊乱。此外，调查纽约市五岁儿童接触多环芳烃的研究表明，认知能力下降，并表明他们可能在儿童注意力缺陷多动障碍 (ADHD) 行为问题中发挥作用
		2. While the underlying mechanisms by which PAHs may render such neurocognitive impairments are not fully understood, human and animal studies have implicated endocrine dysfunction, disruption of placental growth factors that lower oxygenation and nutrition during fetal development, DNA damage of the embryoprotective p53 pathway causing missed checkpoints in the cell cycle that trigger neuronal apoptosis, neurotoxicity via oxidative stress and inhibition of homeostatic DNA methylation. Since PAHs are hydrophobic and can remain in the body for weeks, they can accumulate to a critical dose in the periphery, which can permeate the lipophilic blood-brain-barrier membrane contributing to a plethora of pathologies, including the induction of neurological diseases. Finally, PAHs have been shown to modulate Aβ aggregation through the possible formation of micelle-like Aβ-PAH co-aggregates that may induce fibril-forming aggregation pathways. Taken together, while more studies are required to uncover the underlying mechanisms of how PAHs affect the CNS, there is evidence nevertheless that they partake in the AN component of the ATN model for ADRD. 虽然PAHs可能导致这种神经认知障碍的潜在机制尚不完全清楚，但人类和动物研究涉及内分泌功能障碍，胎盘生长因子的破坏，降低胎儿发育过程中的氧合和营养，胚胎保护p53途径的DNA损伤导致细胞周期中遗漏的检查点，触发神经元凋亡，通过氧化应激产生的神经毒性 和稳态DNA甲基化的抑制。由于多环芳烃是疏水性的，可以在体内保留数周，它们可以在周围积累到临界剂量，这可以渗透亲脂性血脑屏障膜，导致多种病理，包括诱导神经系统疾病。最后，PAHs已被证明通过可能形成胶束样a β-PAH共聚集体来调节a β 聚集，这可能会诱导形成原纤维的聚集途径。总之，虽然需要更多的研究来揭示多环芳烃如何影响中枢神经系统的潜在机制，但有证据表明，它们参与了ADRD的ATN模型的一个组成部分。
	9. Neurocognitive Effects of WTC Dust Cloud
		1. We have seen how exposures to PM2.5 can more readily enter the brain and cause oxidative stress, neurovascularization, neuroinflammation, reductions in white matter density and accelerated brain aging along with evidence of A, T and N. Likewise, PM2.5 exposures have been linked with higher aMCI and volumetric decreases in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, precuneus and the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, which are all signature ADRD regions, in addition to overall decreases across cognitive domains. Furthermore, since PAHs are hydrophobic and can remain in the body for weeks, they can have detrimental effects on white matter density, working memory, cognitive performance,  exacerbate neuroinflammation and modulate Aβ aggregation, all of which contribute to significant neurodegeneration. Taken together, WTC exposures to PM10, PM2.5 and PAH may have indeed had a pronounced neurodegenerative effect on responders, affecting their neurocognitive performance as time has passed. Knowledge of these effects offers an investigative platform for which to monitor specific WTC exposures in the cognitive and neurobiological domains of responders. Indeed, as we will outline below, previous and ongoing investigations of exposed WTC responders are suggestive of the above phenomena, but also highlight the need for further study to clarify the types of exposures, specifically within the context of delineating the duration of PM2.5 exposures in each responder, and their subsequent observable symptoms and pathology. 我们已经看到PM2.5暴露如何更容易进入大脑并引起氧化应激，神经血管化，神经炎症，白质密度降低和加速大脑衰老以及A，T和N的证据。同样，PM2.5暴露与海马，内嗅皮层，杏仁核，梭状回，前突和扣带回峡部的较高aMCI和体积降低有关，这些都是特征ADRD区域，除了整个认知领域的总体降低外。此外，由于PAHs是疏水性的，可以在体内停留数周，因此它们可能对白质密度，工作记忆，认知能力产生有害影响，加剧神经炎症并调节a β 聚集，所有这些都有助于显着的神经变性。总而言之，*WTC暴露于PM10，PM2.5和PAH*可能确实对应答者产生了明显的神经退行性影响，随着时间的流逝，影响了他们的神经认知能力。对这些影响的了解提供了一个调查平台，用于监测响应者的认知和神经生物学领域中的特定WTC暴露。确实，正如我们将在下面概述的那样，以前和正在进行的对暴露的WTC响应者的调查都暗示了上述现象，但也强调需要进一步研究以阐明暴露的类型，特别是在描述PM2.5暴露持续时间的背景下在每个响应者中，以及随后可观察到的症状和病理。
		2. Recognizing that WTC dust exposures may also have independent effects on CNS functioning, Clouston et al,. employed highly sensitive computer-administered measures of memory and processing speed in WTC responders and discovered that long-term exposures to the WTC geographic domain resulted in a systematic reduction in functioning across all tested domains of cognition. Further research has also reported that such exposures are associated with increased incidence of MCI, with APOE4 carriers identified as being at higher risk. Likewise, recent neuroimaging work in our lab has demonstrated that cortical atrophy in WTC responders with MCI is present throughout the temporal lobe, in a pattern that is consistent with recent work in individuals chronically exposed to high levels of air pollution. Clouston等人认识到WTC粉尘暴露也可能对CNS功能产生独立影响。在WTC响应者中采用了高度敏感的计算机管理的内存和处理速度度量，并发现长期暴露于WTC地理域导致所有测试认知域的功能系统性降低。进一步的研究还报告说，这种暴露与MCI的发生率增加有关，APOE4携带者被确定为处于较高风险。同样，我们实验室最近的神经成像工作表明，WTC MCI应答者的皮质萎缩存在于颞叶，其模式与长期暴露于高水平空气污染的个体的最新工作一致。
		3. Taken together, these results suggest that the impact of not only acute and severe, but chronic mild exposures to PM10, PM2.5 and PAHs, during the search and rescue efforts following the WTC disaster, might have incited accelerated brain aging and, perhaps, even caused an emerging neurodegenerative disease, almost two decades later. However, the above reports of WTC and general population exposures to PM and detrimental CNS effects raise an important discussion regarding our understanding for the temporal latency period from time of PM exposure to the presentation of observable symptoms. 综上所述，这些结果表明，*在WTC灾难后的搜索和救援工作中，不仅急性和严重，而且慢性轻度暴露于PM10，PM2.5和PAHs的影响可能会加速大脑衰老*，甚至可能导致近二十年后出现的神经退行性疾病。但是，上述有关WTC和普通人群暴露于PM和有害CNS影响的报道提出了关于我们对从PM暴露时间到出现可观察症状的时间潜伏期的理解的重要讨论。
	10. Latency Periods between PM exposure and the presentation of symptoms
		1. In the research community, we have seen, a growing body of evidence that supports the hypothesis that inhaled PM is likely to cause ADRD. The causal chain in these studies consistently identifies linkages between inhaled PM to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Collating and visualizing this information together into pathways, reveals that PM exposures are often articulated as linking inhaled PM either through a process of neural infiltration, which results in neurotoxicity (solid pathway in Figure 2), or through a process of chronic inflammation (dashed pathway in Figure 2) or, more likely, through a mixed process (incorporating dotted lines with solid and dashed lines in Figure 2). 在研究界，我们已经看到，越来越多的证据支持吸入PM可能导致ADRD的假设。这些研究中的因果链一致地确定了吸入PM与神经炎症和神经变性之间的联系。将这些信息整理并可视化到途径中，揭示了PM暴露通常被阐明为通过*神经浸润过程* (导致神经毒性 (图2中的固体途径) 或通过*慢性炎症过程* (图2中的虚线途径) 或更可能的是，通过混合过程 (在图2中结合带有实线和虚线的虚线)。
			1. ![[Pasted image 20230928185651.png|600]]
		2. Illustrating these pathways can be informative, as it could better elucidate how the response to inhaled PM can cause an aging-related disease with a potentially very long latency period. However, integrating a consideration for the effect of an acute and severe exposure among fully-grown adults, such as that from when the WTC towers collapsed, challenges researchers to explicitly consider the mechanisms linking such a one-time exposure to  outcomes decades later. Moreover, individuals chronically exposed to lower levels of PM poses an equally challenging study. These considerations indicate the requirement to identify and integrate a latency period in PM exposure-induced AD pathogenesis as it is becoming increasingly clear that such acute and pronounced, or chronic and low-level exposures to airborne pollutants may result in different pathways to disease with different underlying mechanisms, characteristics, and by necessity, different risk factors. 说明这些途径可以提供信息，因为它可以更好地阐明对吸入PM的反应如何导致与衰老相关的疾病，潜在的潜伏期很长。然而，综合考虑成年成年人的急性和严重暴露的影响，例如从WTC塔倒塌时开始的影响，要求研究人员明确考虑将这种一次性暴露与几十年后的结果联系起来的机制。此外，长期暴露于较低水平的PM的个体构成了同样具有挑战性的研究。这些考虑表明需要识别和整合PM暴露诱导的AD发病机理中的潜伏期，因为越来越清楚的是，这种*急性*和明显的，或*慢性*和低水平的空气污染物暴露*可能导致不同的疾病途径*，具有不同的潜在机制，特征，不同的风险因素。
		3. The least restrictive view for a pathway lies within inhaled PM causing a chronic inflammatory response to chronic PM exposure thereby eliciting a concomitant chronic neuroinflammatory response (Figure 3). While this theory does provide a mechanism for both old age vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, since it suggests that age-related increases in risk likely result from the timing needed to cause immune-regulated damages, it is not clear whether such a neuroinflammatory cascade is feasible when considering a single inhaled exposure occurring in early adulthood or at midlife. Rather, it appears to suggest that chronic, perhaps lifelong exposures, are necessary to sustain a sufficient immune reaction necessary to render neural damage. Nevertheless, this pathway circumvents the need for PM exposures to cross the BBB, since these processes engage a neuroimmune cascade that might allow a pathway for which materials that are too large or irregular in shape and unable to cross the air-blood barrier (ABB) or BBB, to persist a more chronic deleterious neurological effect with latency periods that are chronically being refreshed. 途径的限制性最小观点在于吸入PM引起慢性PM暴露的慢性炎症反应，从而引发伴随的慢性神经炎症反应 (图3)。虽然该理论确实为老年人对神经退行性疾病的脆弱性提供了一种机制，因为它表明与年龄相关的风险增加可能是由于引起免疫调节损害所需的时间而引起的，当考虑在成年早期或中年发生的单次吸入暴露时，这种*神经炎症级联反应*是否可行尚不清楚。相反，它似乎表明慢性，也许是终身暴露，是维持足够的免疫反应以造成神经损伤所必需的。尽管如此，该途径避免了PM暴露穿过BBB的需要，因为这些过程参与了神经免疫级联反应，这可能允许材料过大或形状不规则且无法穿过空气-血液屏障 (ABB) 或BBB的途径，以长期刷新的潜伏期持续更慢性的有害神经作用。

		4. Studies in Germany, New York City and other areas of high pollution reported that residing with chronic exposure to non-neurally infiltrating PM such as NO2, resulted in globally lower cognitive performance as a function of accelerated brain aging with the emergence of aMCI and reduced cortical thickness in AD signature regions. Moreover, animal studies reveal that such exposures promote the translocation of peripheral inflammatory responses to neuroinflammatory cascades that lead to evidence for changes in the ATN model. Furthermore, chronic PAHs have been reported to be detrimental to the developing and developed brain with white matter volume disturbances, endocrine dysfunctions and since they can remain in the body for weeks, can inflect chronic neuroinflammation with evidence of developing the AN component of the ATN model for ADRD. Therefore, this pathway illustrates how chronic PM exposures that do not neurally infiltrate can lead to systematic immunologic responses in the periphery can lead to neurodegeneration. 在德国，纽约市和其他高污染地区的研究报告说，长期暴露于非神经浸润性PM (例如NO2) 中，随着aMCI的出现而导致全球认知能力降低，这是大脑加速衰老的功能并减少AD签名区域的皮质厚度。此外，动物研究表明，这种暴露会促进外周炎症反应向神经炎症级联的转移，从而为ATN模型的变化提供证据。此外，据报道，慢性PAHs对白质体积紊乱，内分泌功能障碍的发育和发育的大脑有害，并且由于它们可以在体内停留数周，因此可以改变慢性神经炎症，并有证据表明发展了ADRD的ATN模型。因此，该途径说明了不神经浸润的慢性PM暴露如何导致外周的系统性免疫反应可能导致神经变性。
		5. An alternative pathway to the one above, hypothesizes that inhaled PM enters solely through the periphery, thereby causing pathology in the body via chronic reactions to foreign pathogens that cannot be cleared from the periphery (Figure 4). In effect, this pathway suggests that low-grade inflammation indicates not necessarily a cascade, but rather a sustained immunologic response to the presence of a material that need not actually be directly neurotoxic, but rather must be located in a place where the body cannot naturally rid itself of these particles, or else be of particular nature such that it cannot be readily captured and removed from the body. In such as case, a single exposure with a toxic material would sufficiently have the potential to cause a chronic immune response, in part because these lodged PM in the periphery might inhabit the lungs or gut, and may additionally infiltrate the blood, but would not necessarily infiltrate the brain but nevertheless elicit an auxiliary and chronic neuroinflammatory response that leads to neurodegeneration. In this pathway,  the latency period may indicate the influence of systemic and systematic immune responses elevating the risk of a neuropathological cascade, either because the neuroimmune response may cause the cascade or because the elevated glial activation may accelerate the proliferation of ATN changes generated via an independent process. 上述途径的另一种途径，假设吸入的PM仅通过外围进入，从而通过对无法从外围清除的外来病原体的慢性反应在体内引起病理 (图4)。实际上，该途径表明，低度炎症不一定表明级联反应，而是对一种物质的持续免疫反应，这种物质实际上不需要直接具有神经毒性，而是必须位于身体不能自然摆脱这些颗粒的地方，或者具有特殊的性质，使得它不能轻易地从身体中捕获和移除。在这种情况下，单次接触有毒物质将有足够的潜力引起慢性免疫反应，部分原因是这些滞留在周围的PM可能居住在肺部或肠道，并可能另外渗入血液，但不一定会渗入大脑，但会引发辅助和慢性神经炎症反应，导致神经变性。在该途径中，潜伏期可能表明全身和系统免疫反应的影响，从而提高了神经病理级联反应的风险，这是因为神经免疫反应可能导致级联反应，或者是因为神经胶质激活升高可能会加速ATN变化的增殖通过一个独立的过程。

		6. Likewise, an alternative pathway may present to the brain more directly, but also more stochastically by relying on the systemic vulnerabilities to infiltration of neurotoxic materials directly into the brain as the main neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanism. Specifically, PM inhalation might either enter the brain in one of at least two ways; indirectly via proliferation from the ABB into the blood as seen in Figure 4, but with an additional caveat that it must additionally cross the BBB; or, infiltrate the brain directly via transduction from the olfactory cortex. In either case, for such a pathway to be engaged, the presence of neurotoxic PM must be either immediately or eventually physically present within the brain itself. Neuroinflammation, would then emerge as a direct response to PM and may cause neurodegeneration to emerge in specific, affected regions of the brain. For example, where PM first infiltrates the brain, it may subsequently proliferate slowly to other regions passively distributed via cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or actively distributed by glia, which would ineffectively phagocytose PM and end up distributing it throughout the brain when they regurgitate indigestible infiltrate. This theory helps to explain potentially long latency periods and because PM must infiltrate the brain. 同样，另一种途径可能更直接地呈现给大脑，但也更随机地依靠全身性脆弱性将神经毒性物质直接渗透到大脑中作为主要的神经炎症和神经变性机制。具体地说，吸入PM可能以至少两种方式中的一种进入大脑; 通过从ABB到血液中的增殖间接地进入大脑，如图4所示，但需要另外注意的是，它必须另外穿过BBB; 或者，通过嗅觉皮层的转导直接渗透大脑。在任何一种情况下，要使这种途径参与，神经毒性PM的存在必须立即或最终在大脑本身内物理存在。然后，神经炎症将作为对PM的直接反应出现，并可能导致神经变性出现在大脑的特定受影响区域。例如，当PM首先浸润大脑时，它可能随后缓慢增殖到其他区域，这些区域通过脑脊液动力学被动分布或神经胶质细胞主动分布，这将无效地吞噬PM，并在它们反流时最终将其分布在整个大脑中。难以消化的浸润。该理论有助于解释潜在的长潜伏期，并且因为PM必须渗透到大脑中。
		7. Indeed, there is a plethora of evidence to suggest the existence of such a directly neurotoxic pathway, with early evidence stemming from research in Mexico City which demonstrated that PM2.5 infiltrate disrupted the BBB, and caused oxidative stress, neurovascularization and neuroinflammation along with evidence of A, T and N in canines, children and young adults. While other studies with direct PM2.5 exposures displayed white matter disruptions, accelerated brain aging, higher incidence of aMCI, working memory, orientation, and verbal learning deficits along with other cognitive impairments. Mechanisms of neurotoxicity have been implicated TRPM2, COX and PSD95 channel pathways, hippocampal neuron spine density reductions and oxidative stress along with mitochondrial and myelin sheath disruptions and changed in the A component of the ATN model for ADRD. Likewise, evidence for this model can also be derived from UFPM exposures, where direct inhalations promote complex neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, at the olfactory, hippocampal, and entorhinal regions. Moreover, nPM, the smallest of particle pollutants, lend further credence to this model as their neural infiltration, whether directly from the olfactory cortex or crossing the BBB from peripheral circulation, do also lead to complex neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity and resulting neurodegeneration, also with changes in the A component of the ATN model for ADRD. 事实上，有大量证据表明存在这种直接的神经毒性途径，早期证据来自墨西哥城的研究，该研究表明PM2.5渗透破坏了BBB，并引起氧化应激，神经血管化和神经炎症，以及犬中a，T和N的证据，儿童和年轻人。而其他直接暴露于PM2.5的研究显示白质破坏，加速的大脑衰老，aMCI的发生率更高，工作记忆，定向力和言语学习缺陷以及其他认知障碍。神经毒性的机制涉及TRPM2，COX和PSD95通道通路，海马神经元脊柱密度降低和氧化应激以及线粒体和髓鞘破坏，并在ADRD的ATN模型的A组件中发生了变化。同样，该模型的证据也可以从UFPM暴露中得出，在UFPM暴露中，直接吸入会在嗅觉，海马和内嗅区域促进复杂的神经炎症和神经毒性。此外，nPM是最小的颗粒污染物，为该模型提供了进一步的证据，因为它们的神经浸润，无论是直接从嗅觉皮层还是从外周循环穿过BBB，也会导致复杂的神经炎症，神经毒性和神经变性，此外，ADRD的ATN模型的A组件也发生了变化。
		8. Taken together, the above hypotheses modelling particulate matter exposures and their effects on the CNS are not only useful in furthering our understanding for potential mechanisms of cause and effect, but also provide a foundational understanding that pragmatically, it may often be the case that a combination of these models is in effect. Potential strategies aiming to distinguish between these three temporal models must first employ identification of PM aerosol sizes in the exposures. For example, if it is known that inhaled PM exposures involved PM small enough to cross the BBB for direct neural  infiltration, then such an observation would lend more credence to considering the model displayed in *figure 5*. If such PM exposures are known to be chronic, then the model portrayed in figure 3 may be more likely, with or without the concurrent presence of the model in figure 5. Knowing the specific size, amount and chronicity of PM exposures would better serve to answer the latter question, insofar in that if there is a large, transient exposure to finer PM size, the neural infiltrate model is highly likely to be in effect, whereas chronic, low-level exposures to finer PM sizes would likely engage the immunologic response model, with some consideration of the neural infiltrate also. However, if individuals are exposed to larger PM sizes that cannot cross the BBB, then it is more likely that detrimental neurocognitive effects would arise indirectly through the systemic entry model in figure 4, and if chronic, would also contain elements from the immunologic response model. Therefore, in order to effectively consider and apply one of the above proposed models for temporal latency between PM exposures and observable neurocognitive symptoms, appropriate classification of PM sizes in exposures are paramount before proceeding. 综上所述，对颗粒物暴露及其对中枢神经系统的影响进行建模的上述假设不仅有助于进一步理解因果关系的潜在机制，而且还提供了一个基本的理解，即务实地，通常情况下这些模型的组合是有效的。旨在区分这三个时间模型的潜在策略必须首先使用暴露中PM气溶胶大小的识别。例如，如果已知吸入的PM暴露涉及足够小的PM以穿过BBB进行直接神经浸润，那么这样的观察将为考虑图5中显示的模型提供更多的可信度。如果已知此类PM暴露是慢性的，则无论是否同时存在图5中的模型，图中描绘的模型5月3日更有可能。了解PM暴露的具体大小，数量和长期性将更好地回答后一个问题，因为如果存在较大的瞬时暴露于较小的PM大小，则神经浸润模型很可能有效，而慢性，低水平暴露于更细的PM大小可能会参与免疫反应模型，同时还考虑了神经浸润。然而，如果个体暴露于不能穿过BBB的较大的PM大小，则更有可能通过图4中的系统进入模型间接产生有害的神经认知效应，并且如果是慢性的，也将包含来自免疫反应模型的元素。因此，为了有效地考虑和应用上述提出的PM暴露和可观察到的神经认知症状之间的时间潜伏期模型之一，在进行之前，对暴露中的PM大小进行适当分类至关重要。

	11. Potential Synergistic Effects with pre-existing risk factors
		1. Many of the above theories rest on the ability for NPM to infiltrate the brain. A number of known conditions are believed to influence BBB permeability and may therefore augment any effects of additional exposures or of infiltration into the brain when potentially toxic material remains chronically distributed throughout the exposed person’s system following a severe exposure. One crucial component of these exposures at midlife include exposurerelated psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Evidence from animal models has demonstrated that such traumatic events can trigger neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration , and that bouts of stress can disrupt the BBB , are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , and increased distribution of c-reactive protein , potentially accelerating PM infiltration and it’s detrimental effects on the brain. However, recent studies in animal models are highlighting molecular mechanisms of resilience to BBB disruptions in neurobehavioral mood disorders . Furthermore, PTSD is often co-existent with traumatic brain injury  , for which there is a plethora of evidence for BBB disruptions in TBI , which can further augment the detrimental effects of any concurrent PM exposures on the brain. Vascular compromisation of the BBB can also be detected in individuals carrying the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) AD susceptibility gene , individuals with hypertension  and those who have suffered from ischemic stroke , which once again, can potentially further exacerbate PM induced neurodegeneration. Therefore, future research strategies that can effectively measure such pre-existing risk factors can help disentangle and elucidate an individuals’ detrimental susceptibility to PM exposures, aiding in the identification and classification of high risk and/ or resilient groups. 上述许多理论都基于 NPM 渗透大脑的能力。 *许多已知的情况被认为会影响血脑屏障的渗透性*，因此当潜在的有毒物质在严重接触后仍长期分布在接触者的整个系统中时，可能会增加额外接触或渗透到大脑的任何影响。 中年时期这些暴露的一个重要组成部分包括与暴露相关的精神疾病，例如创伤后应激障碍（*PTSD*）*或重度抑郁症*（MDD）。 来自动物模型的证据表明，此类创伤事件会引发神经炎症和神经退行性变，而压力的发作会破坏血脑屏障，与心血管疾病风险增加以及c反应蛋白分布增加有关，可能会加速PM渗透和 它对大脑产生有害影响。 然而，最近对动物模型的研究强调了神经行为情绪障碍中对血脑屏障破坏的恢复能力的分子机制。 此外，创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 通常与创伤性脑损伤并存，有大量证据表明 TBI 中 BBB 中断，这可能进一步加剧任何并发 PM 暴露对大脑的有害影响。 在携带载脂蛋白 E4 (APOE4) AD 易感基因的个体、高血压患者和患有缺血性中风的个体中也可以检测到 BBB 的血管受损，这可能会进一步加剧 PM 引起的神经变性。 因此，未来的研究策略可以有效地衡量这些预先存在的风险因素，有助于理清和阐明个人对PM暴露的有害易感性，有助于识别和分类高风险和/或有弹性的群体。
		2. Measuring the size and source of PM exposures would serve as one, albeit major avenue in delineating which temporal pathway is involved between the latency period of exposure and observable neurocognitive symptoms, however, establishing which model has taken effect may require post-hoc analysis from when observable symptoms and/or pathology has arisen. For example, imaging studies employing PET radioligand biomarkers may be able to  identify relevant neuropathology as a result of known prior PM exposures. Alternatively, post-mortem histopathology for such biomarkers may serve as a standard of truth for the presence of neuropathology for which to associate known exposures with. Nevertheless, since PM exposures can be small and invisible, and can persist chronically or incur acutely with a large dose, such as that seen when the WTC towers fell, it is recommended for the research community to have appropriate measures in place in order to, at-the-very-least be able to appropriately characterize the size and nature of the offending PM exposures. 测量PM暴露的大小和来源将成为描述暴露潜伏期和可观察到的神经认知症状之间涉及哪个时间途径的主要途径，但是，建立哪个模型已生效可能需要事后分析从何时出现可观察到的症状和/或病理。例如，使用PET放射性配体生物标志物的成像研究可能能够识别由于已知的先前PM暴露而导致的相关神经病理学。或者，此类生物标志物的死后组织病理学可以作为与已知暴露相关的神经病理学存在的真实标准。尽管如此，由于PM暴露可能很小且不可见，并且可以长期持续或以大剂量急性发作，例如WTC塔楼倒塌时所见，建议研究界采取适当的措施，以便，至少能够恰当地描述违规PM暴露的大小和性质。
	12. Potential Strategies to Differentiate between the temporal models
		1. The thee hypotheses noted above differ in a number of critical ways. First, more research is needed that examines the role of pre and post-WTC exposure activities that may be augmenting any potential inflammation, so as to determine to what extent the WTC exposures were capable of acting alone or if instead they catalyzed existing or follow-up exposures as suggested in Figure 3. Second, we have determined that WTC PTSD is associated with immunologic dysregulation evident in peripheral markers, however no work to date has examined whether WTC exposures directly resulted in immunologic dysregulation. Further work is, therefore, necessary to detect whether the presence of a neuroinflammatory environment is feasible as suggested in Figure 4. Finally, there is a difference in mechanism that can be reliably examined only using novel methods to either detect the presence of chronic non-biologic WTC particulate matter in the brains of WTC responders. This last effort requires that individuals provide neuronal tissue at time of death for post-mortem histopathological analyses and would be central to determine whether WTC dust might have infiltrated the brain as hypothesized in Figure 5. 区分时间模型的潜在策略上述假设在许多关键方面有所不同。首先，需要更多的研究来检查可能会增强任何潜在炎症的WTC暴露前后活动的作用，以便确定WTC暴露在多大程度上能够单独起作用，或者它们是否催化了现有的或后续的暴露，如图3所示。其次，我们已经确定WTC PTSD与外周标记物中明显的免疫失调有关，但是迄今为止尚未研究WTC暴露是否直接导致免疫失调。因此，需要进一步的工作来检测神经炎症环境的存在是否可行，如图4所示。最后，只有使用新颖的方法来检测WTC应答者大脑中慢性非生物WTC颗粒物的存在，才能可靠地检查其机制上的差异。最后的努力要求个体在死亡时提供神经元组织以进行死后组织病理学分析，并且将是确定WTC粉尘是否可能渗入大脑的核心，如图5中假设的那样。
	13. Conclusions 
		1. Inhaled PM is ubiquitous and invisible, making it especially difficult to identify relationships between exposures and symptoms. However, it is also unique in having the chemical structure necessary to act as a neurotoxin and is also able to concurrently incite an immune response, while also, under the right circumstances, filter through the blood-brain barrier. In the present report, we highlighted an increasing number of studies that have identified several pathways linking inhaled neurotoxic materials to incidence of ADRD in old age, along with evidence for the ATN model of ADRD. We then drew examples from our own work with the WTC population exposures from when the towers collapsed on 9/11, along with providing theoretical frameworks highlighting the importance of latency periods between PM exposures and subsequent detrimental CNS effects. Further work is required to determine the degree to which PM exposures are attributable for sporadic ADRD. However, it is also critical that we improve detection methods to better distinguish mechanisms linking inhaled PM subtypes with ADRD as such factors may concurrently provide novel treatment targets necessary for policymakers to protect future generations from chronically debilitating neurological diseases. Such efforts will greatly benefit the furthering of our understanding of how PM exposures affect the CNS, not only in the WTC exposed responders, but also the increasingly at-risk world population. 吸入PM是普遍存在且不可见的，这使得识别暴露与症状之间的关系特别困难。然而，它的独特之处在于具有作为*神经毒素所必需的化学结构，并且还能够同时激发免疫反应*，同时在适当的情况下通过血脑屏障过滤。在本报告中，我们强调了越来越多的研究，这些研究已经确定了将吸入的神经毒性物质与老年ADRD发生率联系起来的几种途径，以及ADRD ATN模型的证据。然后，我们从我们自己的工作中得出了一些例子，这些例子是从9/11塔倒塌时的WTC人群暴露，并提供了理论框架，突出了PM暴露和随后有害的CNS效应之间的潜伏期的重要性。需要进一步的工作来确定PM暴露归因于零星ADRD的程度。然而，同样重要的是，我们改进检测方法，以更好地区分将吸入PM亚型与ADRD联系起来的机制，因为这些因素可能同时为政策制定者提供新的治疗目标，以保护后代免受慢性衰弱的神经系统疾病。这些努力将极大地促进我们对PM暴露如何影响CNS的理解，不仅在WTC暴露的响应者中，而且在日益危险的世界人口中。

- Abstract
	- The explosion and collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) was a catastrophic event that produced an aerosol plume impacting many workers, residents, and commuters during the first few days after 11 September 2001. Three bulk samples of the total settled dust and smoke were collected at weather-protected locations east of the WTC on 16 and 17 September 2001; these samples are representative of the generated material that settled immediately after the explosion and fire and the concurrent collapse of the two structures. We analyzed each sample, not differentiated by particle size, for inorganic and organic composition. In the inorganic analyses, we identified metals, radionuclides, ionic species, asbestos, and inorganic species. In the organic analyses, we identified polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, pesticides, phthalate esters, brominated diphenyl ethers, and other hydrocarbons. Each sample had a basic pH. Asbestos levels ranged from 0.8% to 3.0% of the mass, the PAHs were > 0.1% of the mass, and lead ranged from 101 to 625 µg/g. The content and distribution of material was indicative of a complex mixture of building debris and combustion products in the resulting plume. These three samples were composed primarily of construction materials, soot, paint (leaded and unleaded), and glass fibers (mineral wool and fiberglass). Levels of hydrocarbons indicated unburned or partially burned jet fuel, plastic, cellulose, and other materials that were ignited by the fire. In morphologic analyses we found that a majority of the mass was fibrous and composed of many types of fibers (e.g., mineral wool, fiberglass, asbestos, wood, paper, and cotton). The particles were separated into size classifications by gravimetric and aerodynamic methods. Material < 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter was 0.88–1.98% of the total mass. The largest mass concentrations were > 53 µm in diameter. The results obtained from these samples can be used to understand the contact and types of exposures to this unprecedented complex mixture experienced by the surviving residents, commuters, and rescue workers directly affected by the plume from 11 to 12 September and the evaluations of any acute or long-term health effects from resuspendable dust and smoke to the residents, commuters, and local workers, as well as from the materials released after 11 September until the fires were extinguished. Further, these results support the need to have the interior of residences, buildings, and their respective HVAC systems professionally cleaned to reduce long-term residential risks before rehabitation. 
	-  世界贸易中心（WTC）的爆炸和坍塌是一场灾难性事件，在2001年9月11日之后的头几天里，产生了影响许多工人、居民和通勤者的气溶胶羽流。==2001年9月16日和17日==，在世贸中心以东受天气保护的地点收集了三个总沉降灰尘和烟雾的散装样本；这些样品代表了在爆炸和火灾以及两个结构同时倒塌后立即沉降的生成材料。我们分析了每个样品的无机成分和有机成分，不按颗粒大小区分。在无机物分析中，我们鉴定了金属、放射性核素、离子物种、石棉和无机物种。在有机分析中，我们鉴定了多环芳烃（PAHs）、多氯联苯、多氯联苯、二苯并二恶英、多氯联苯二苯并呋喃、杀虫剂、邻苯二甲酸酯、溴化二苯醚和其他碳氢化合物。每个样品都有一个基本的pH值。石棉含量范围为质量的0.8%至3.0%，多环芳烃含量>质量的0.1%，铅含量范围为101至625µg/g。物质的含量和分布表明，产生的烟羽中存在建筑碎片和燃烧产物的复杂混合物。这三个样品主要由建筑材料、烟灰、油漆（含铅和无铅）和玻璃纤维（矿棉和玻璃纤维）组成。碳氢化合物的含量表明未燃烧或部分燃烧的喷气燃料、塑料、纤维素和其他被大火点燃的材料。在形态学分析中，我们发现大部分肿块是纤维状的，由多种类型的纤维组成（如矿棉、玻璃纤维、石棉、木材、纸张和棉花）。通过重量分析和空气动力学方法将颗粒分为大小分类。==空气动力学直径<2.5µm的材料占总质量的0.88–1.98%==。最大质量浓度直径>53µm。从这些样本中获得的结果可用于了解9月11日至12日直接受烟羽影响的幸存居民、通勤者和救援人员对这种前所未有的复杂混合物的接触和接触类型，和当地工人，以及9月11日之后释放的材料，直到大火被扑灭。此外，这些结果支持了在重新安置之前对住宅、建筑物内部及其各自的暖通空调系统进行专业清洁的必要性，以降低长期居住风险。
- Introduction
	- The 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City (NYC) resulted in an intense fire and the subsequent complete collapse of the two main structures and adjacent buildings. It also led to significant damage to many surrounding buildings within and around the WTC complex. The 16-acre area has become known as Ground Zero. A consequence of the pulverization of buildings and the fires was the development of a large plume of dust and smoke that released both particles and gases into the atmosphere. The initial plume impacted all directions immediately adjacent to the WTC site, and the dust and smoke settled at many outdoor and indoor locations. From the first hours to 18 hr after the collapse, the winds transported the plume to the east (Figure 1) and then to the southeast across and beyond Brooklyn, New York. To begin assessing the exposure to dust and smoke among the residential and commuter population during the first few days, samples of particles that initially settled in downtown NYC were taken from three undisturbed protected locations to the east of the WTC site. Two samples were taken on day 5 (16 September 2001) and the third sample was taken on day 6 (17 September 2001) after the terrorist attack. The purposes for collecting the samples were a) to determine the chemical and physical characteristics of the material that was present in the dust and smoke that settled from the initial plume, and b) to determine the absence or presence of contaminants that could affect acute or long-term human health by inhalation or ingestion. It was anticipated that the actual compounds and materials present in the plume would be similar to those found in building fires or implosion of collapsed buildings. The primary differences would be the simultaneous occurrence of each type of event, the intense fire (> 1,000°C), the extremely large mass of material (> 10 × 106 tons) reduced to dust and smoke, and the previously unseen degree of pulverization of the building materials. A summary of the potentially present types of carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic materials was reported in EHPin November 2001 (1).
	- 2001年9月11日对纽约市世界贸易中心的袭击导致一场大火，随后两座主要建筑和相邻建筑完全倒塌。它还导致世贸中心建筑群内和周围的许多周围建筑遭到严重破坏。这片占地16英亩的土地被称为归零地。建筑物粉碎和火灾的后果是形成了大量的灰尘和烟雾，将颗粒和气体释放到大气中。最初的羽流影响了WTC现场附近的所有方向，灰尘和烟雾沉积在许多室外和室内位置。从坍塌后的最初几个小时到18小时，风将烟羽向东输送（图1），然后向东南输送，穿过纽约布鲁克林。为了开始评估最初几天居民和通勤人群暴露在灰尘和烟雾中的情况，从WTC现场以东的三个未受干扰的保护地点采集了最初在纽约市中心沉降的颗粒物样本。两个样本是在恐怖袭击发生后的第5天（2001年9月16日）采集的，第三个样本则是在恐怖攻击后的第6天（2001月17日）采集。收集样本的目的是：a）确定初始烟羽沉降的灰尘和烟雾中存在的物质的化学和物理特性，以及b）确定是否存在可能通过吸入或摄入影响急性或长期人类健康的污染物。预计烟羽中存在的实际化合物和材料将与建筑火灾或倒塌建筑内爆中发现的化合物和材料相似。主要差异是每种类型的事件同时发生，强烈的火灾（>1000°C），大量的材料（>10×106吨）减少为灰尘和烟雾，以及建筑材料以前看不到的粉碎程度。EHPin于2001年11月报道了潜在致癌和非致癌物质类型的总结（1）。

	- The dust and smoke would be inhaled by individuals either directly or after the ==settled aerosol was resuspended by turbulence==. Deposition and retention of the dust and smoke on surfaces inside homes, as well as the residuals of dust and smoke remaining if residences and building ventilation systems were not properly cleaned before rehabitation, would be available for uptake by children and adults via nondietary ingestion. Indoor inhalation exposures would also be possible because of ==resuspension== from the ventilation system. Any large-particle inhalation could also lead to ingestion exposure after particles are cleared from the upper airways of the lung by mucocilliary clearance processes. A number of initial measurements made by various organizations focused on the general composition of the dust and smoke, with a primary concern being asbestos (1). The approach we used for analyzing the three dust and smoke samples included detailed measurement of the inorganic and organic components of the mass and a general characterization of the percent distribution by mass or volume of various materials present in each sample. Samples of the total settled dust and smoke were collected at three different locations. The first sample was collected from protected external ledges around the entrance of a building on Cortlandt Street, which is one block east of the WTC building complex. The initial direction of the plume was from west to east (Figure 1); thus, the other two samples were collected at locations to the east of Cortlandt Street. These two samples were collected from 10–15 cm-thick deposits that were on the top of two automobiles about 0.7 km from the WTC site. The automobiles were in locations protected from rain that occurred on Friday, 15 September 2001. One automobile was located on Cherry Street, and the other was on Market Street, one and two city blocks, respectively, west of the East River between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges. These cars appeared to have been in their respective locations since 11 September, but it is possible that each could have been moved from an adjacent thoroughfare on the east side of NYC (FDR Drive). One of the reasons for collecting samples from these locations was to determine whether chemical composition and physical morphology of the particles changed with distance from the WTC site. The samples were collected using the protocols established for surface soil collection in our studies of the dispersal of chromium-laden hazardous waste in Jersey City, New Jersey (2), and the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (3). After collection, all samples were stored in a 4°C room prior to sending the subfractions to individual laboratories for analysis. We maintained chain of custody throughout sample transferal and analyses.
	- 灰尘和烟雾会被个人直接吸入，或者在沉降的气溶胶被湍流重新悬浮后吸入。家庭表面的灰尘和烟雾的沉积和滞留，以及如果在重新居住前没有对住宅和建筑通风系统进行适当清洁，残留的灰尘和烟将可供儿童和成人通过非饮食摄入。由于通风系统的再悬浮，室内吸入暴露也是可能的。任何大颗粒吸入也可能导致摄入暴露，因为颗粒通过粘液清除过程从肺上呼吸道清除。各组织进行的一些初步测量侧重于灰尘和烟雾的一般成分，主要关注石棉（1）。我们用于分析三个灰尘和烟雾样本的方法包括对质量的无机和有机成分的详细测量，以及对每个样本中存在的各种材料的质量或体积百分比分布的一般表征。在三个不同的地点收集了总沉降灰尘和烟雾的样本。第一个样本是从Cortlandt街一栋建筑入口处受保护的外部壁架上采集的，该建筑位于WTC建筑群以东一个街区。羽流的初始方向是从西向东（图1）；因此，另外两个样本是在Cortlandt街以东的地点采集的。这两个样本是从距离WTC现场约0.7公里的两辆汽车顶部的10-15厘米厚沉积物中采集的。这些汽车位于2001年9月15日星期五发生的防雨地点。一辆汽车位于樱桃街，另一辆位于市场街，分别位于曼哈顿大桥和布鲁克林大桥之间东河以西的一个和两个城市街区。自9月11日以来，这些车似乎一直在各自的位置，但每辆车都可能是从纽约市东侧的一条相邻大道（FDR Drive）移走的。从这些位置收集样品的原因之一是确定颗粒的化学成分和物理形态是否随着距离WTC位点的距离而变化。样本是使用我们在新泽西州泽西市对含铬危险废物扩散的研究（2）和国家人类暴露评估调查（3）中为表层土壤收集制定的方案收集的。采集后，将所有样品储存在4°C的房间中，然后将亚组分送往各个实验室进行分析。我们在整个样品转移和分析过程中保持着监管链。
- Method
	- The analyses conducted on each sample were based on the nature of the sources of the particles that were aerosolized on 11 September 2001. The force of the collapse pulverized the two main WTC structures and several adjacent low-rise buildings (e.g., WTC3, WTC7); therefore, our analytic plan included qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect construction and furnishing debris, and combustible materials and products of incomplete combustion associated with the fires in each building. We accomplished the tasks by completing analyses to identify inorganic and organic constituents. We designed the first sets of analyses to provide a general characterization of the content of the samples using a combination of microscopic techniques. This provided an opportunity to classify the general morphology and to focus the chemical analyses subsequently performed on each sample based on the types of materials detected by the microscopic analyses. The second type of analyses included the inorganic analyses (including trace and toxic elements, ionic species, and functional groups) and the organic analyses *including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, dioxins, furans, phthalate esters, and general hydrocarbons*]. All of these analyses were performed exclusively on the total of bulk samples. The third set of analyses included the particle size fractionation experiments on each sample. We used two different approaches: a) a gravimetric sieving analysis that separated the mass of lint and nonfibrous material into fractions > 300 µm, 75–300 µm, and < 75 µm in diameter; and b) an aerodynamic separation for the particle size fractions of < 2.5 µm, 2.5–10 µm, and 10–53 µm in diameter, with a gravimetric sieving that separated the particles > 53 µm in diameter before the aerodynamic sizing of the samples. The separations were based on the design or availability of specific size separation techniques in the laboratories. We selected all of the analyses described above for the three bulk samples based on the nature of the events and the materials that could be associated with the buildings and the burning jet fuel. The collapse resulted in a pulverization of the buildings. Thus, it was important to complete morphologic analyses to obtain a general idea about the composition and the structure of the particles that were produced from the building materials. We conducted the organic analyses to determine the chemical nature of the products of incomplete combustion produced by the fires and to identify any other organic materials. The inorganic analyses were completed to obtain quantitative information on the levels of various heavy metals and other inorganic materials present in the pulverized building materials and in the fire. Finally, we conducted the particle size analyses to provide a general description of the types and levels of material available that could be inhaled and deposited in various locations within the lung. These size-separated samples were stored for analyses of the same compounds in the individual size fractions. These results are the subject of future manuscripts.
	- 对每个样本进行的分析是基于2001年9月11日雾化颗粒来源的性质。坍塌的力量粉碎了两个主要的WTC结构和几个相邻的低层建筑（如WTC3、WTC7）；因此，我们的分析计划包括定性和定量分析，以检测建筑和装修碎片，以及与每栋建筑火灾相关的可燃材料和不完全燃烧产物。我们通过完成分析以鉴定无机和有机成分来完成任务。我们设计了第一组分析，以使用显微镜技术的组合提供样品含量的一般表征。这提供了一个机会，可以对一般形态进行分类，并根据显微镜分析检测到的材料类型，对随后对每个样品进行的化学分析进行重点分析。第二类分析包括无机分析（包括微量和有毒元素、离子物种和官能团）和有机分析[包括多环芳烃、多氯联苯、杀虫剂、二恶英、呋喃、邻苯二甲酸酯和一般碳氢化合物]。所有这些分析都是专门对全部散装样品进行的。第三组分析包括每个样品的粒度分级实验。我们使用了两种不同的方法：a）重量筛分分析，将皮棉和非纤维材料的质量分为直径>300µm、75–300µm和<75µm的部分；和b）对直径<2.5µm、2.5–10µm和10–53µm的粒级进行空气动力学分离，在对样品进行空气动力学定径之前，用重量筛分离直径>53µm的颗粒。分离是基于实验室中特定尺寸分离技术的设计或可用性。根据事件的性质以及可能与建筑物和燃烧的喷气燃料有关的材料，我们选择了上述三个散装样本的所有分析。坍塌导致建筑物粉碎。因此，重要的是完成形态学分析，以获得关于建筑材料产生的颗粒的组成和结构的总体概念。我们进行了有机分析，以确定火灾产生的不完全燃烧产物的化学性质，并确定任何其他有机材料。完成了无机分析，以获得有关粉碎建筑材料和火灾中存在的各种重金属和其他无机材料水平的定量信息。最后，我们进行了颗粒尺寸分析，以提供可吸入和沉积在肺部不同位置的可用材料的类型和水平的一般描述。将这些尺寸分离的样品储存起来，用于分析单个尺寸级分中的相同化合物。这些结果是未来手稿的主题。

	- Because each of the total mass dust and smoke samples was determined to contain a complex mixture of materials, the analytic plan required the inclusion of a number of different techniques for examining chemical and physical characteristics. Our approach included microscopic analysis to identify major components and the morphology of particles in each sample. Using stereomicroscopy, we estimated relative percentages of larger particles and identified large dust components. We used polarized light microscopy with microchemical testing to identify most particles including minerals, building products, and hair and fibers > 1 µm in diameter. We used scanning electron microscopy with X-ray elemental analysis to identify metal fragments, building product pieces, and other particles < 1 µm. Transmission electron microscopy, with electron diffraction and Xray elemental analysis was used to identify the smallest fraction of particles including single asbestos fibrils and carbon soot. We extracted the portions of each total mass sample (not differentiated by particles size) for determination of trace and toxic elements by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy; ion chromatography was used to determine the ionic and cationic components of the mass. Other portions of each total mass sample were then extracted and analyzed for organic constituents. We included materials that are typically measured in air or dust samples by gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques; we then scanned for unknown extracts using other mass spectroscopic analyses. Other analyses completed on these total mass samples included the measurement of pH, corrosion, aerodynamic particle size for fine and coarse particle fractions, percentage of mass by particle sieving, general radiation levels, and asbestos. Details on each analysis conducted on the three dust and smoke samples are provided below.
	- 由于每一个总质量的灰尘和烟雾样本都被确定含有复杂的材料混合物，因此分析计划需要包括许多不同的技术来检查化学和物理特性。我们的方法包括显微镜分析，以确定每个样品中的主要成分和颗粒形态。使用立体显微镜，我们估计了较大颗粒的相对百分比，并确定了较大的灰尘成分。我们使用偏振光显微镜和微化学测试来识别大多数颗粒，包括矿物、建筑产品、头发和直径>1µm的纤维。我们使用扫描电子显微镜和X射线元素分析来识别金属碎片、建筑产品碎片和其他<1µm的颗粒。使用透射电子显微镜、电子衍射和X射线元素分析来识别最小比例的颗粒，包括单个石棉原纤维和炭黑。我们提取了每个总质量样品的部分（不按颗粒大小区分），用于通过电感耦合等离子体光谱法测定微量元素和有毒元素；使用离子色谱法测定质量中的离子和阳离子成分。然后提取每个总质量样品的其他部分并分析有机成分。我们包括了通常通过气相色谱和质谱技术在空气或灰尘样品中测量的材料；然后，我们使用其他质谱分析扫描未知提取物。对这些总质量样品完成的其他分析包括pH值、腐蚀、细颗粒和粗颗粒的空气动力学颗粒尺寸、颗粒筛分质量百分比、一般辐射水平和石棉的测量。以下提供了对三个灰尘和烟雾样本进行的每次分析的详细信息。

	- Morphologic and gravimetric analyses. The dust samples were characterized by both gravimetric measurement of sieved size fractions and by polarized light microscopy analyses. The samples were sieved using standard 4-inch diameter brass sieves (U.S. Standard Sieve Mesh 50 and 200) as reported previously (4). The gravimetric determinations were made in triplicate with a SETRA EZ2-500 electronic 3-place balance (Setra Systems, Inc., Boxborough, MA). All samplehandling activities were performed inside a hood with a HEPA exhaust filter. Samples were separated into fibrous (lint) and nonfibrous fractions using tweezers under the stereomicroscope. Indoor dust has been shown to be composed of both fibrous and nonfibrous fractions (5). The fibrous and nonfibrous parts are expected to respond differently to dust disruptions, which include cleaning procedures. We determined the weight of the lint (plus attached fine nonfibrous particulate). The remaining particulate was then dry sieved at the following size fractions: > 300 µm (collected on Mesh 50), 75–300 µm (collected on Mesh 200), < 75 µm (through Mesh 200). The weight of each fraction was determined and the relative weight percentages were then calculated. The lint fraction is found in the large (> 300 µm) fraction. The fractions were combined and examined by stereomicroscopy using a Zeiss Stemi 2000 stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with a magnification range of 6.5× to 47×. The physical characteristics of the samples were then analyzed using an Olympus BH-2 polarized light microscope (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY) with a magnification range of 40× to 1,000×. A visual estimate was made of the relative percentage by volume of loosely aggregated separable fibrous lint (hair + natural fibers + manmade fibers). Each sample was characterized morphologically for major constituents using a form developed by MVA (4,6). Identified constituents were then rated as to whether it was “common” (consistently found throughout the sample) or “present” (detected but infrequently) (7–11). This designation does not necessarily indicate the relative abundance of a constituent by weight or volume within a sample; it is an indictor of numerical abundance of a constituent. The < 75 µm size fraction portion was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which was performed using a JEOL 6400 (JEOL Inc., Peabody, MA) equipped with a Noran Voyager energy dispersive X-ray analysis unit (Noran Instruments, Inc., Middleton, WI) and both the secondary and backscattered modes. For SEM analysis, portions of the particles from the sample were transferred to conductive carbon tape and coated with a thin layer of carbon to provide a conductive surface in the electron microscope. Using the backscattered electron mode, the sample was examined for particles that contained heavy elements. This procedure is useful in locating particles containing toxic metals such as lead and cadmium. Using the secondary electron mode, the sample was examined for particles that were consistent with asbestos fibers. We performed X-ray elemental analysis (energy dispersive spectrometry) on each particle located for further study by either the backscattered electron or secondary electron scans. We prepared the < 75 µm size fraction of the samples following the ASTM D6602 procedure (6) and analyzed them with analytic electron microscopy using a JEOL 1200, 100 kV scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with a Noran energy dispersive spectrometry X-ray analysis system. Each sample was subjected to morphologic and gravimetric analyses.
	- *形态学和重量分析*。通过筛分粒度的重量测量和偏振光显微镜分析对粉尘样品进行了表征。如前所述（4），使用标准4英寸直径的黄铜筛（美国标准筛网50和200）对样品进行筛分。用SETRA EZ2-500电子三位天平（SETRA Systems，股份有限公司，Boxborough，MA）进行重量测定，一式三份。所有样品处理活动均在配有高效空气过滤器的罩内进行。在立体显微镜下使用镊子将样品分离为纤维状（皮棉）和非纤维状部分。室内灰尘已被证明由纤维和非纤维部分组成（5）。纤维和非纤维部件预计对灰尘干扰的反应不同，包括清洁程序。我们测定了皮棉的重量（加上附着的细小非纤维颗粒）。然后将剩余颗粒按以下粒度进行干筛：>300µm（在筛网50上收集）、75-300µm（筛网200上收集）和<75µm（通过筛网200）。测定每个馏分的重量，然后计算相对重量百分比。皮棉部分存在于较大（>300µm）的部分中。将级分合并，并使用蔡司Stemi 2000立体显微镜（Carl Zeiss，股份有限公司，Thornwood，NY）通过立体显微镜检查，放大倍数范围为6.5×至47×。然后使用奥林巴斯BH-2偏振光显微镜（Olympus America，股份有限公司，Melville，NY）分析样品的物理特性，放大倍数范围为40×至1000×。对松散聚集的可分离纤维皮棉（头发天然纤维-人造纤维）的相对体积百分比进行了目测。使用MVA（4，6）开发的形式对每个样品的主要成分进行形态学表征。然后，根据其是“常见”（在整个样本中始终发现）还是“存在”（检测到但不频繁）对已识别的成分进行评级（7-11）。该名称不一定表示样品中成分的相对丰度（按重量或体积计）；它是一种成分数量丰度的指标。通过扫描电子显微镜（SEM）分析<75µm尺寸的部分，该扫描电子显微镜使用配备Noran Voyager能量色散X射线分析单元（Noran Instruments，股份有限公司，Middleton，WI）的JEOL 6400（JEOL股份有限公司，Peabody，MA）以及二次和背向散射模式进行。对于SEM分析，将来自样品的部分颗粒转移到导电碳带上，并用碳薄层涂覆以在电子显微镜中提供导电表面。使用反向散射电子模式，检查样品中是否含有重元素的颗粒。该程序可用于定位含有铅和镉等有毒金属的颗粒。使用二次电子模式，检查样品中与石棉纤维一致的颗粒。我们对定位的每个粒子进行了X射线元素分析（能量色散光谱法），以通过反向散射电子或二次电子扫描进行进一步研究。我们按照ASTM D6602程序（6）制备了尺寸小于75µm的样品，并使用配备Noran能量色散光谱X射线分析系统的JEOL 1200、100kV扫描透射电子显微镜用分析电子显微镜对其进行分析。对每个样品进行形态学和重量分析。

	- Aerodynamic particle separation. The samples were first mechanically separated using a sieve with a mesh size of 53 µm. The fraction of particles < 53 µm was further separated aerodynamically into three size fractions: 10–53 µm, 2.5–10 µm, and < 2.5 µm. Particles were resuspended by a jet of filtered air passing through an inlet (Wedding Inlet, 10 µm cut size; Anderson Instrument Co., Fultonville, NY) before entering a cyclone with a cut size of 2.5 µm (BGI, Inc., Waltham, MA). Particles between 10 and 2.5 µm were collected by the cyclone, whereas particles < 2.5 µm, which penetrated through the cyclone, were collected on Teflon filters
	- *空气动力学颗粒分离*。首先使用网目尺寸为53µm的筛网对样品进行机械分离。<53µm的颗粒部分在空气动力学上进一步分离为三个尺寸部分：10–53µm、2.5–10µm和<2.5µm。在进入切割尺寸为2.5µm的旋风分离器（BGI，股份有限公司，Waltham，MA）之前，通过穿过入口（Wedding inlet，切割尺寸为10µm；Anderson Instrument Co.，Fultonville，NY）的过滤空气射流重悬颗粒。旋风分离器收集10至2.5µm之间的颗粒，而穿透旋风分离器的<2.5µm的颗粒则收集在聚四氟乙烯过滤器上

	- Corrosion. We evaluated the corrosive properties of the dust samples using copper mirrors. For each dust sample, a small amount was sprinkled onto a copper mirror and a second copper mirror was set aside as a control; hence, there were a total of three exposed mirrors and three controls. These six mirrors were placed in a sealed container together with a beaker of water to maintain the relative humidity near 100%. After a 14day exposure, the samples were examined for pinholes and discoloration. Radionuclides. We analyzed the gamma spectrum of the samples using an EG&G/Ortec high-purity Ge detector (50% relative efficiency) gamma counter (EG&G/Ortec Instruments, Inc., Oak Ridge, TN). We analyzed approximately 50 peaks based on statistical significance (counting/lack of interferences). These included thorium, uranium, actinium series, and primordial radionuclides. Liquid scintillation analyses were conducted for emissions on the total dust and smoke samples using a Packard Tri-Carb Model 2770 TR/SL (Packard Instrument, Meriden, CT). The MDA for alpha radioactivity was 0.30 DPM (0.14 pCi) based on a NIST-traceable 226Ra standard (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). When placed in the liquid scintillation fluid, the WTC samples are somewhat darker than the backgrounds and calibration standard, which may cause slight underreporting of the beta activity due to quenching and standard-tosample efficiency bias. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for trace and toxic elements. All samples were analyzed in duplicate for trace or toxic elements. Approximately 0.1 g of sample was accurately weighed and placed in a CEM HP500 microwave vessel (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC). Fisher optima concentrated nitric acid (10 mL) was then added to the vessels. The six sample vessels plus those of two method blanks were sealed and placed in the CEM MARS microwave unit at 1,200 watts for 5 min. The samples were allowed to cool for approximately 15 min inside the MARS unit and were then removed and placed in the cold room for 1 hr at 4°C. After cooling, the samples were then diluted to 50 mL. A 2-mL aliquot was then diluted to 8 mL for a final acid concentration of 5%. We scanned the samples for metals on a Fissons PQ3 ICP/MS (Fissons Instruments, Inc., Merrimac, MA) over a mass range of 9–238 at 1,350 watts, with a dwell time of 1,000 µsec with 40 sweeps for a total acquisition time of 70 sec. We used high purity multielement standard and NIST A&B calibrant for quality control. Acceptable quality assurance checks were deemed to be 100 ± 20% of the certified values.
	- *腐蚀*我们使用铜镜评估了灰尘样品的腐蚀性。对于每个灰尘样品，将少量的灰尘撒在铜镜上，并将第二个铜镜放在一边作为对照；因此，总共有三个暴露的镜子和三个对照。将这六个镜子与烧杯水一起放置在密封容器中，以保持接近100%的相对湿度。暴露14天后，对样品进行针孔和变色检查。*放射性核素*。我们使用EG&G/Ortec高纯度Ge探测器（50%相对效率）伽马计数器（EG&G/Ortec Instruments，股份有限公司，Oak Ridge，TN）分析样品的伽马光谱。我们根据统计显著性（计数/无干扰）分析了大约50个峰值。其中包括钍、铀、锕系和原始放射性核素。使用Packard Tri-Carb型号2770 TR/SL（Packard Instrument，Meriden，CT）对总灰尘和烟雾样品的排放进行液体闪烁分析。根据NIST可追溯的226Ra标准（美国国家标准与技术研究所，马里兰州盖瑟斯堡），α放射性的MDA为0.30 DPM（0.14 pCi）。当放置在液体闪烁液中时，WTC样品比背景和校准标准稍微暗一些，这可能会由于猝灭和标准到样品效率偏差而导致β活性的轻微报告不足。*微量元素和有毒元素的电感耦合等离子体质谱（ICP-MS）分析*。所有样品均进行了微量元素或有毒元素分析，一式两份。精确称量约0.1g样品，并将其置于CEM HP500微波容器（CEM Corporation，Matthews，NC）中。然后将Fisher optima浓硝酸（10mL）加入到容器中。将六个样品容器加上两个方法空白的样品容器密封并放置在功率为1200瓦的CEM MARS微波装置中5分钟。将样品在MARS装置内冷却约15分钟，然后取出并放置在4°C的冷藏室中1小时。冷却后，将样品稀释至50mL。然后将2mL等分试样稀释至8mL，使最终酸浓度为5%。我们在Fissons PQ3 ICP/MS（Fissons Instruments，股份有限公司，Merrimac，MA）上以1350瓦的功率在9–238的质量范围内扫描样品中的金属，停留时间为1000µsec，扫描40次，总采集时间为70秒。我们使用高纯度多元素标准和NIST a&B校准品进行质量控制。可接受的质量保证检查被认为是认证值的100±20%。

	- Ion chromatography for ionic species and pH analyses. We weighed the samples (Fisher Scientific XT Balance; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and placed them in test tubes; aliquots of distilled, deionized water were added to make a concentration of approximately 30 mg/mL. The tubes were inverted several times and were then sonicated. The samples were left at room temperature for several days before centrifugation. The extract from each filter sample was removed to a new test tube before centrifugation. All samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was removed to new tubes and stored in the refrigerator. A 1-mL aliquot of extract was used for pH measurement. This was performed using an Orion Research Digital pH Meter 611 (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). The ion analysis was performed using a Dionex DX500 system. The anion analyses column-IonPac AS14 (Dionex) was used in Suppressor-ASRS Ultra-AutoSuppressor Recycle Mode. The eluent was 3.5 mM Na2CO3/1.0mM NaHCO3. We used cation analyses column IonPac CS12A in the Suppressor-CSRS II Ultra-AutoSuppressor Recycle Mode. The eluent was 20 mM methanesulfonic acid. We constructed calibration curves using seven standards prepared by diluting a NISTtraceable standard (Fisher) using Milli-Q water. Each standard was subsequently run as a sample to verify the calibration curve. Samples were run once the calibration curve was verified. After all samples were analyzed, these seven standards were analyzed again, followed by two additional NIST traceable stock standards (Dionex). Samples that were originally off scale were diluted with Milli-Q water and tested again.
	- *离子物种和pH分析的离子色谱法*。我们称重样品（Fisher Scientific XT Balance；Fisher Scientificy，Pittsburgh，PA），并将其放入试管中；加入等分的蒸馏去离子水以使浓度达到约30mg/mL。将试管倒置几次，然后进行超声波处理。在离心之前，将样品在室温下放置几天。在离心之前，将每个过滤器样品的提取物移到新的试管中。将所有样品离心，并将上清液移到新的试管中并储存在冰箱中。将1mL的提取物等分试样用于pH测量。这是使用Orion Research数字pH计611（Dionex Corporation，Sunnyvale，CA）进行的。使用Dionex DX500系统进行离子分析。阴离子分析柱IonPac AS14（Dionex）用于抑制器ASRS超自动抑制器循环模式。洗脱液为3.5mM Na2CO3/1.0M NaHCO3。我们在抑制器CSRS II超自动抑制器回收模式中使用阳离子分析柱IonPac CS12A。洗脱液为20mM甲磺酸。我们使用通过使用Milli-Q水稀释NIST可追溯标准品（Fisher）制备的七个标准品构建校准曲线。随后将每个标准品作为样品运行，以验证校准曲线。一旦校准曲线得到验证，就运行样品。分析完所有样品后，再次分析这七种标准品，然后再分析另外两种NIST可追溯库存标准品（Dionex）。用Milli-Q水稀释最初不合格的样品，并再次进行测试。

	- Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. Each sample was analyzed for functional groups by FTIR after a portion of the sample was converted to a standard infrared pellet. The pellet was made by combining a small quantity of sample dust material (~ 30 mg) and approximately 200 mg of spectrograde potassium bromide powder (ICL Laboratories, Garfield, NJ). This mixture was preliminarily ground together using an agate motor and pestle, then transferred to a metal vial and placed in a mixing mill (SPEX Model 5300; SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) and agitated for 30 sec at approximately 50 cycles/sec. The resultant homogeneous mixture was then transferred to a die (13 mm Macro-Micro KBr pellet die; ICL Laboratories) connected to a vacuum pump, which was placed in a lab press. Approximately 8,500 psi was applied to the mixture for 30 secs. The resulting infrared pellet consisted of a mid-infrared transparent solid matrix of potassium bromide containing a uniform distribution of the dust sample to be analyzed. We obtained all infrared spectra using an FTIR Spectrometer (Mattson Instruments, Madison, WI) (12). The spectrometer was configured to obtain standard transmission FTIR spectra using a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. Each spectrum collected was an average of 200 scans at 4/cm resolution. The resulting profile was illustrated as a plot of percent transmittance of infrared radiation as a function of wave number from 4,000 to 450/cm. The transmission spectra of the three samples were then examined for functional group content. Volatile organic compounds. We used thermal desorption (Perkin-Elmer ATD400; Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) with a gas chromatograph (GC)/MS detector (Hewlett Packard 5890/5971; Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE) to analyze samples of dust from the destruction of the World Trade Center complex for volatile organic compounds. Approximately 200 mg of each of the three samples were heated at 180°C for 1 min in a stainless steel tube with the emitted compounds transferred in a helium stream to a Tenax absorbent trap (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) held at –28°C. The absorbent trap was heated to 250°C within a few seconds, with the compounds transferred to a capillary GC/MS. Full scan mass spectra were collected above 30 atomic mass units (amu) to identify the volatile compounds. The chromatographic peaks were identified based on comparisons to standards run under the same conditions as the samples, evaluation of the mass spectral pattern, and library matches within the Wiley Mass Spectra Library (The Wiley/NBS Registry of Mass Spectral Data). Due to the unresolved background present in the chromatograph after a retention time of 20 min, we performed a background subtraction of an area near each peak of interest before the library search. Semivolatile organic chemical analysis. Many of the compounds or compound classes measured for semivolatile organics were analyzed by well-established techniques for PAHs, PCBs, dioxins, and furans. However, because the fire at the WTC was very complex and included the burning of fuel, plastics, furniture, and other materials, we conducted additional analyses to detect and quantify unknown organics in the total mass samples. These are described below.
	- *傅立叶变换红外光谱法*。在将一部分样品转化为标准红外颗粒后，通过FTIR分析每个样品的官能团。该颗粒是通过将少量样品粉尘材料（约30 mg）和约200 mg光谱级溴化钾粉末（ICL Laboratories，Garfield，NJ）混合制成的。使用玛瑙马达和研杵将该混合物初步研磨在一起，然后转移到金属小瓶中，并放置在混合磨机（SPEX Model 5300；SPEX Industries，Edison，NJ）中，并以大约50次循环/秒的速度搅拌30秒。然后将所得均匀混合物转移到连接到真空泵的模具（13mm Macro-Micro-KBr颗粒模具；ICL Laboratories）中，该模具放置在实验室压机中。将大约8500磅/平方英寸施加到混合物上30秒。所得红外颗粒由溴化钾的中红外透明固体基质组成，该基质含有待分析的均匀分布的灰尘样品。我们使用FTIR光谱仪（Mattson Instruments，Madison，WI）获得所有红外光谱（12）。将光谱仪配置为使用氘化硫酸三甘氨酸检测器获得标准透射FTIR光谱。所收集的每个光谱是以4/cm分辨率进行的平均200次扫描。所得到的分布图示为红外辐射的透射率百分比作为4000至450/cm波数的函数的图。然后对三个样品的透射光谱进行官能团含量检测。
	- *挥发性有机化合物*。我们使用热解吸（Perkin Elmer ATD400；Perkin El默，Norwalk，CT）和气相色谱（GC）/MS检测器（Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971；Hewlett-Packard，Wilmington，DE）来分析世贸中心综合体被毁后的灰尘样品中的挥发性有机化合物。三个样品中的每一个样品约200 mg在不锈钢管中在180°C下加热1分钟，排放的化合物在氦气流中转移到温度保持在-28°C的Tenax吸收阱（Supelco，Bellefonte，PA）中。吸收阱在几秒内加热至250°C，将化合物转移到毛细管GC/MS中。在30个原子质量单位（amu）以上收集全扫描质谱以鉴定挥发性化合物。色谱峰是根据与在与样品相同条件下运行的标准品的比较、质谱模式的评估以及Wiley质谱库（The Wiley/NBS Registry of mass spectral Data）中的库匹配来确定的。由于在20分钟的保留时间后色谱仪中存在未解析的背景，我们在文库搜索之前对每个感兴趣的峰附近的区域进行了背景减法。
	- *半挥发性有机化学分析*。通过PAHs、PCBs、二恶英和呋喃的成熟技术分析了许多半挥发性有机物的化合物或化合物类别。然而，由于WTC的火灾非常复杂，包括燃料、塑料、家具和其他材料的燃烧，我们进行了额外的分析，以检测和量化总质量样本中的未知有机物。下文将对此进行描述。
	- Standard PAH, chlordane, and PCB analyses. Each sample was analyzed by GC/MS on a Hewlett Packard 6890/5973 for 40 individual PAHs and six chlordane species (oxy-chlordane, trans-chlordane, cischlordane, trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, and MC5), and by GC/electron capture detection with a Hewlett Packard 6890 equipped with a 63Ni electron capture detector for quantification of 68 PCB congeners, hexachlorobenzene, DDTs (4,4´-DDE, 2,4´-DDT, and 4,4´-DDT), and mirex (13,14). By weighing triplicate aliquots of approximately 0.7 g of each dust sample, ultrasonically extracting each in 30 mL dichloromethane, and reducing the volume before analysis, we identified and quantified all compounds against known concentrations of authentic standards and NIST Standard Reference Material 1649a (Urban Dust, Organics) (15), which was processed in parallel with each sample for comparison and verification of the results. Unknown semivolatile hydrocarbon identification. The analysis for semivolatile organic compounds included microwaveassisted solvent extraction (MASE) followed by GC/ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS) (16,17). MASE was carried out using an MDS-2000 microwave extraction system (CEM) equipped with an inboard pressure control system. The MDS-2000 is able to extract 12 samples simultaneously in Teflon PFA-lined extraction vessels under approximately the same conditions of temperature and pressure. A 2.5-g portion of each sample was accurately weighed and quantitatively transferred into Teflon PFA-lined extraction vessels of the MDS-2000. We added extraction solvents (7.5 mL methylene chloride-acetone; 1:1 v/v) to each vessel and fitted new rupture membranes into each cap, which screwed onto the vessel. We then placed the vessels symmetrically on the microwave turntable. After the extraction was completed, the vessels were allowed to cool before the caps were opened. After cooling, we transferred 1.5 mL extract from the supernatant of the vessels into GC vials without a preconcentration step before GC/ITMS analysis. We performed GC/MS on a Varian 3400 CX GC coupled to a Saturn 2000 GC/MS ITMS (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). A septum programmable split/splitless injector was used in the splitless mode. The GC was equipped with a 30-m 5% phenyl/95% dimethylsilicone fused silica DB-XLB capillary column with 0.32 mm i.d. and 0.25 µm film thickness (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The ITMS was operated in electron ionization-positive mode and optimized with perfluorotributylamine (FC-34) using automatic gain control. The electron multiplier, emission current, and modulation amplitude were set at 1,800 V, 10 µA, and 7.5 V, respectively. The transfer line and the ion trap manifold were set to 270°C and 225°C, respectively. The mass range scanned was from 45 to 450 m/z at 0.3–0.6 sec/scan. We used Saturn GC/MS workstation version 5.3 software for data acquisition. We identified the analytes by comparing the mass spectrum (after background subtraction) to the vendor’s library and NIST 98 library spectrum. As with the identification of other unknowns, we defined a positive identification as one with a correlation to the library spectrum of > 85% fit. We added EPA 525 internal standards (Supelco) to the sample run as quality control checks for rough quantitation and retention time quality control. A secondary identification was performed using retention time confirmation with quality control standards, when available. We analyzed a 1-µL aliquot of standard with the GC/ITMS system under the same conditions used for samples and quality control samples. Approximately 300 semivolatile organic compound standards including EPA 525, 625, and 8270 standards (Supelco) were injected to build the GC retention time library. We defined a retention time match as an analyte compound eluting within ± 5 sec of the standard sample retention time. All reported compounds met these criteria.
	- *标准多环芳烃、氯丹和多氯联苯分析*。每个样品在Hewlett-Packard 6890/5973上通过GC/MS分析40种单独的PAHs和六种氯丹（氧氯丹、反式氯丹、顺式氯丹，反式九氯、顺式九氯和MC5），并使用配备63Ni电子捕获检测器的Hewlett-Packard 6880通过GC/电子捕获检测，滴滴涕（4,4´-DDE、2,4-´-DDT和4,4´-DDT）和灭蚁灵（13,14）。通过称量每种灰尘样品约0.7g的三份等分试样，在30mL二氯甲烷中超声提取每一份，并在分析前减少体积，我们根据真实标准和NIST标准参考物质1649a（城市灰尘，有机物）的已知浓度鉴定并量化了所有化合物（15），其与每个样品并行处理，用于比较和验证结果。
	- *未知的半挥发性碳氢化合物鉴定*。半挥发性有机化合物的分析包括微波辅助溶剂萃取（MASE），然后是GC/离子阱质谱仪（ITMS）（16，17）。MASE使用配备有内侧压力控制系统的MDS-2000微波提取系统（CEM）进行。MDS-2000能够在大约相同的温度和压力条件下，在聚四氟乙烯PFA内衬的提取容器中同时提取12个样品。每个样品的2.5g部分被精确地称重并定量地转移到MDS-2000的聚四氟乙烯PFA衬里的提取容器中。我们向每个容器中添加提取溶剂（7.5 mL二氯甲烷-丙酮；1:1 v/v），并在每个盖子中安装新的破裂膜，将其拧到容器上。然后，我们将容器对称地放置在微波转台上。提取完成后，在打开盖子之前，让容器冷却。冷却后，我们将容器上清液中的1.5mL提取物转移到GC小瓶中，而无需在GC/ITMS分析前进行预浓缩步骤。我们在耦合到Saturn 2000 GC/MS ITMS（Varian Instruments，Palo Alto，CA）的Varian 3400 CX GC上进行GC/MS。在无分流模式下使用隔膜可编程分流/无分流注射器。GC配备有30-m 5%苯基/95%二甲基硅氧烷熔融二氧化硅DB-XLB毛细管柱，内径0.32 mm，膜厚0.25µm（J&W Scientific，Folsom，CA）。ITMS在电子电离正模式下操作，并使用自动增益控制用全氟三丁胺（FC-34）进行优化。电子倍增器、发射电流和调制幅度分别设置为1800 V、10µA和7.5 V。传输线和离子阱歧管分别设置为270°C和225°C。扫描的质量范围为45至450 m/z，每次扫描0.3–0.6秒。我们使用Saturn GC/MS工作站5.3版软件进行数据采集。我们通过将质谱（背景相减后）与供应商的库和NIST 98库光谱进行比较来确定分析物。与其他未知的鉴定一样，我们将阳性鉴定定义为与文库光谱的相关性>85%的鉴定。我们在样品运行中添加了EPA 525内部标准品（Supelco），作为粗略定量和保留时间质量控制的质量控制检查。在可用的情况下，使用质量控制标准的保留时间确认进行二次鉴定。我们用GC/ITMS系统在与样品和质量控制样品相同的条件下分析了1µL等分标准品。注入大约300个半挥发性有机化合物标准品，包括EPA 525、625和8270标准品（Supelco），以建立GC保留时间库。我们将保留时间匹配定义为在标准样品保留时间±5秒内洗脱的分析物化合物。所有报道的化合物都符合这些标准。
	- Polychlorinated dioxins (PCDDs) and furans (PCDFs). We used U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Methods 1613 and RCRA SW846 Method 8290 for dioxin analyses (18,19). In these methods, a clean extraction thimble was charged with 5.0 g of 100/200-mesh silica topped with 100 g of quartz sand. The silica layer was left undisturbed throughout the extraction process. The thimble was placed in a clean extractor with 30–40 mL of toluene in the receiver and 200–250 mL of toluene in the flask. The wet sample, filter, and/or disk were loaded and any nonaqueous liquid removed. The remaining sample was placed in the thimble and manually mixed into the sand layer with a clean metal spatula, carefully breaking up any large lumps of sample. The dust and smoke extracts, which were blown to dryness in conical vials and refrigerated, were analyzed via GC/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS) after the addition of an internal standard and nonane. We programmed the column temperature to separate the 2,3,7,8-TCDD congener from other TCDD analytes. The tetra congeners had to be eluted from the column after 20 min for this to occur. The seventeen congeners of interest were then detected with the HRMS. We identified compounds eluting from the GC column by the retention time reference obtained from the corresponding labeled isotope and the ion ratio of the measured ions during selective ion response. We calculated the concentration of each congener by using the relative response factors of each native congener to its respective 13C12-labeled congener. Standards used in the analyses were concentration of stock and spiking solutions containing PCDDs/PCDFs and labeled compounds. We included a cleanup standard (Cl4, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, 0.8 ng/mL) and internal standards (Cl2, 1,2,3,4-TCDD, 200 ng/mL; and Cl2, 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexaCDD, 200 ng/mL). Brominated diphenyl ethers. The analytic methodology for detecting brominated diphenyls and diphenyl ethers have been described previously (20). Briefly, we subjected total dust samples to enhanced solvent extraction using methylene chloride. Extracts were purified by size exclusion and silica gel liquid chromatography. Compound quantification was performed by GC with halogen-selective electrolytic conductivity detection with multipoint calibration. Decachlorodiphenyl ether was used as an internal standard. 2,2´,4,4´,5,6´,6´-Octachlorobiphenyl was added before extraction as a surrogate standard, and results were corrected for its recovery (mean ± SD, 68.1 ± 2.02). We confirmed compound identities by GC/MS in the full scan electron ionization mode. None of the target compounds were detected in the blank
	- *多氯二恶烷和呋喃*。我们使用美国环境保护局（EPA）方法1613和RCRA SW846方法8290进行二恶英分析（18,19）。在这些方法中，向清洁的提取套管中加入5.0g 100/200目二氧化硅，顶部覆盖100g石英砂。二氧化硅层在整个提取过程中保持不受干扰。将顶针放入干净的提取器中，接收器中有30–40 mL甲苯，烧瓶中有200–250 mL甲苯。装载湿样品、过滤器和/或圆盘，并去除任何非水性液体。将剩余的样品放在顶针中，用干净的金属抹刀手动混合到砂层中，小心地打碎任何大块的样品。在加入内标物和壬烷后，通过GC/高分辨率质谱法（GC/HRMS）对在锥形瓶中吹干并冷藏的灰尘和烟雾提取物进行分析。我们对柱温度进行编程，以将2,3,7,8-TCDD同源物与其他TCDD分析物分离。为了发生这种情况，必须在20分钟后从柱中洗脱四同源物。然后用HRMS检测出17个感兴趣的同源物。我们通过从相应的标记同位素获得的保留时间参考和在选择性离子响应过程中测量的离子的离子比来鉴定从GC柱洗脱的化合物。我们通过使用每种天然同源物对其各自的13C12标记同源物的相对响应因子来计算每种同源物的浓度。分析中使用的标准是含有多氯二苯并对二恶英/多氯二呋喃和标记化合物的储备溶液和加标溶液的浓度。我们包括了一个清洁标准品（Cl4，2，3，7，8-CTCDD，0.8 ng/mL）和内标物（Cl2，1，2，2，4，4-CTCDD，200 ng/mL；以及Cl2，2、3、7，8，9-六CDD，200 ng/mL）。溴化二苯醚。前面已经描述了检测溴化二苯基和二苯醚的分析方法（20）。简单地说，我们使用二氯甲烷对全部灰尘样品进行强化溶剂萃取。提取物采用大小排阻法和硅胶液相色谱法进行纯化。化合物的定量通过GC进行，卤素选择性电解电导率检测和多点校准。使用十氯二苯醚作为内标。提取前加入2,2´，4,4´，5,6´，6´-八氯联苯作为替代标准，并对其回收率进行校正（平均值±SD，68.1±2.02）。我们在全扫描电子电离模式下通过GC/MS确认了化合物的同一性。空白中未检测到任何目标化合物
- Results
	- The general characteristics of each total settled dust and smoke sample are shown in Table 1; these characteristics indicate that the composition of major components in each sample were similar, with slight differences in total composition for the Market Street sample. Generally, the samples were very light and fluffy, and were white to pinkish-gray. The general physical appearance of the Market Street sample is shown in Figure 2 as an example. The mass of each sample was dominated by nonfibrous material and construction debris, and the Cortlandt and Cherry Street samples contained approximately 0.8% asbestos. In contrast, of the mass collected, the Market Street sample contained 3.0% asbestos. We found only background levels of alpha radionuclide activity by liquid scintillation counter analysis of all three samples. Beta activity was slightly elevated, but not more than twice the background level. There were no levels of gamma activity > 1 Bq/g except for naturally occurring potassium-40. The pH of an aqueous suspension of each sample was > 7; the Cortlandt Street sample had a pH of 11.5. Both the Cherry and Market Street samples had a pH of ≈9 (Table 1). Significant amounts (≈10% of the mass) of cellulose were found in all three samples. This observation is consistent with the release of large amounts of disintegrated paper and other products that were originally part of the indoor work environments. We detected no differences between the exposed copper mirrors and the controls, indicating that these dust samples were not corrosive toward base metals. This finding is consistent with the pH measurements.
	- 每个总沉降灰尘和烟雾样品的一般特性如表1所示；这些特征表明，每个样本中*主要成分*的成分相似，市场街样本的总成分略有差异。一般来说，样品非常轻盈蓬松，呈白色至粉灰色。Market Street样本的总体物理外观如图2所示。每个样本的质量主要是*非纤维材料和建筑碎片*，Cortlandt和Cherry Street样本含有约0.8%的石棉。相比之下，在收集的大量样本中，市场街的样本含有*3.0%的石棉*。通过对所有三个样本的液体闪烁计数器分析，我们只发现了α放射性核素活性的背景水平。贝塔活性略有上升，但不超过背景水平的两倍。除了天然存在的钾-40外，没有超过1 Bq/g的伽马活性水平。每个样品的水性悬浮液的*pH值＞7*；Cortlandt Street样品的pH值为11.5。Cherry和Market Street样品的pH值均为≈9（表1）。在所有三个样品中都发现了大量的*纤维素*（*≈质量的10%*）。这一观察结果与大量分解纸和其他产品的释放一致，这些产品最初是室内工作环境的一部分。我们检测到暴露的铜镜和对照组之间没有差异，表明这些灰尘样本对贱金属没有腐蚀性。这一发现与pH测量结果一致。
	- Morphologic analyses. Detailed morphologic analyses of each sample supported the general characterizations presented in Table 1. Cortlandt Street sample. The Cortlandt Street sample was mainly composed of construction debris [including vermiculite, plaster, synthetic foam, glass fragments, paint particles, glass fibers, lead (Figure 3), calcite grains, and paper fragments], quartz grains, low-temperature combustion material (including charred woody fragments), and glass shards. Chrysotile asbestos fibers were estimated to comprise < 1% of the sample by volume, and much of the chrysotile adhered to carbonate binder. Some skin cells and dyed cotton fibers were present (5,21–23). The findings of skin cells was consistent with the types of particles usually found in dust in the indoor environment. Approximately 35% of the volume of the sample was in the form of loosely consolidated clumps of fibrous lint, of which the greatest portion was glass fibers. An example of the typical form of the glass fibers is shown in Figure 4. In many cases the width was ≅ 1 µm (to > 10 µm), and the length ranged from 5 to 100 µm. The fiber shown in Figure 4 is not a “clean” glass fiber; other materials are agglomerated along the rod. This is typical of features noted for many different types of particles in each sample. The SEM analysis of the fraction < 75 µm in diameter revealed many glass fibers and cement particles, some in a fibrous form containing calcium, silicon, and sulfur, and some particles were composed of calcium carbonate (Figure 5). Chrysotile asbestos fibers, identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were found in the < 75-µm fraction. None of the analyzed particles contained lead, chromium, cadmium, or mercury, although chromium and cadmium were quantified in this sample by ICP/MS analyses. Cherry Avenue sample. The Cherry Avenue sample is mainly composed of construction debris (including cement, vermiculite, plaster, synthetic foam, glass fragments, mineral wool fibers, paint particles, glass fibers, metals, calcite grains, and paper fragments), quartz grains, low-temperature combustion material (including charred woody fragments), and metal flakes. We estimated that chrysotile asbestos fibers comprised < 1% of the sample by volume. Much of the chrysotile asbestos had carbonate binder adhered to it. We observed some hair fibers and tarry fragments in the sample. Approximately 10% of the volume of the sample was in the form of loosely consolidated clumps of fibrous lint, of which the greatest portion was glass fibers. The SEM analysis of the fraction < 75 µm in diameter revealed many glass fibers and cement particles, some in a fibrous form, containing calcium, silicon, and sulfur. We used SEM and TEM to examine chrysotile asbestos fibers, lead paint fragments, iron–chromium particles, and soot particles found in the < 75-µm fraction. The soot particles were in the submicron size range (Figure 6). No particles containing cadmium (detected by ICP/MS) or mercury were found at less than minimum detection limits in the 1,000 particles analyzed from this sample.
	- 形态学分析。每个样品的详细形态学分析支持表1中所示的一般特征。Cortlandt Street样本。Cortlandt Street样本主要由建筑碎片[包括蛭石、石膏、合成泡沫、玻璃碎片、油漆颗粒、玻璃纤维、铅（图3）、方解石颗粒和纸张碎片]、石英颗粒、低温燃烧材料（包括烧焦的木质碎片）和玻璃碎片组成。温石棉纤维估计占样品体积的<1%，大部分温石棉粘附在碳酸盐粘合剂上。存在一些皮肤细胞和染色的棉纤维（5，21-23）。皮肤细胞的发现与室内环境中通常在灰尘中发现的颗粒类型一致。样品体积的大约35%是松散固结的纤维棉绒团块，其中大部分是玻璃纤维。玻璃纤维的典型形式示例如图4所示。在许多情况下，宽度为？1µm（至>10µm），长度范围为5至100µm。图4所示的纤维不是“干净”的玻璃纤维；其他材料沿着杆聚集。这是每个样品中许多不同类型颗粒的典型特征。对直径<75µm的部分进行的SEM分析显示，有许多玻璃纤维和水泥颗粒，其中一些呈纤维状，含有钙、硅和硫，一些颗粒由碳酸钙组成（图5）。通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）鉴定，在 *<75µm的部分中发现了温石棉纤维*。尽管通过ICP/MS分析对该样品中的铬和镉进行了定量，但所分析的颗粒均不含铅、铬、镉或汞。Cherry Avenue样品。Cherry Avenue样品主要由建筑碎片（包括水泥、蛭石、石膏、合成泡沫、玻璃碎片、矿棉纤维、油漆颗粒、玻璃纤维、金属、方解石颗粒和纸张碎片）、石英颗粒、低温燃烧材料（包括烧焦的木质碎片）和金属薄片组成。我们估计温石棉纤维占样本体积的<1%。大部分温石棉上附着着碳酸盐粘合剂。我们在样品中观察到一些头发纤维和焦油碎片。样品体积的大约10%是松散固结的纤维棉绒团块，其中最大的部分是玻璃纤维。直径小于75µm的部分的SEM分析显示，许多玻璃纤维和水泥颗粒，其中一些呈纤维状，含有钙、硅和硫。我们使用SEM和TEM检查了 *<75µm部分中发现的温石棉纤维、铅涂料碎片、铁-铬颗粒和烟灰颗粒*。烟灰颗粒在亚微米尺寸范围内（图6）。在该样品分析的1000个颗粒中，未发现含有镉（通过ICP/MS检测）或汞的颗粒低于最低检测限。
	- Market Street sample. The Market Street sample was also composed of construction debris (including vermiculite, plaster, synthetic foam, glass fragments, paint particles, mineral wool fibers, glass fibers, calcite grains, and paper fragments), quartz grains, low-temperature combustion material (including charred woody fragments), and metal flakes. Chrysotile asbestos fibers made up < 1% of the sample by volume, and much of the chrysotile adhered to carbonate binder. This result is different from the bulk mass results, which indicated 3.0% asbestos; this indicates that the sample was not homogeneous. Some dyed cotton fibers, tarry fragments, pollen grains, and metal flakes were also present. Approximately 10% of the volume of the sample was in the form of loosely consolidated clumps of fibrous lint, of which the greatest portion was glass fibers. The SEM analysis of the fraction < 75 µm in diameter revealed many glass fibers and cement particles, some in a fibrous form containing calcium, silicon, and sulfur. Chrysotile asbestos fibers, identified by TEM, were found in the fine fraction. We found no particles containing lead, chromium, cadmium, or mercury in the single particles analyzed from the Market Street sample, although all but mercury were detected by the ICP/MS analyses. The morphologic differences between each of the collected samples were minor and could be attributed to the fact that we analyzed only 1,000 particles per sample. This limitation in particle number would preclude consistent detection of all materials that comprise < 0.1% of each sample. A minor difference between the Cortlandt Street and the Market and Cherry Street samples was that the Cortlandt Street sample had 0.88% fine particles (particles < 2.5 µm in diameter), while the other two samples had > 1.1% fine particle mass. Using microscopic analysis to generally describe the distribution of materials among the mass fractions, we found that large particles were primarily made up of building materials including gypsum, glass fiber, mineral wool fibers, wood fibers, and paper fragments. Chrysotile adhered to building material, chrysotile bundles, and plaster were also components of large particles. This is consistent with the fact that the lint with fibrous particle bundles was in the > 300-µm particle size range. The smaller particles (< 75 µm in diameter) included asbestos, soot, lead, and other trace elements. This is consistent with the dual nature of the event—the collapse of two buildings overlaying intensely burning structures—which would result primarily in individual and population exposures to large particles and in much lower exposures to fine particles. However, the large amounts of material in the air during the first 2 days could lead to high exposures within unprotected individuals.
	- 市场街样本。市场街样本还由建筑碎片（包括蛭石、石膏、合成泡沫、玻璃碎片、油漆颗粒、矿棉纤维、玻璃纤维、方解石颗粒和纸张碎片）、石英颗粒、低温燃烧材料（包括烧焦的木质碎片）和金属薄片组成。温石棉纤维占样品体积的<1%，大部分温石棉附着在碳酸盐粘合剂上。这一结果与体积质量结果不同，体积质量结果表明石棉含量为3.0%；这表明样品不均匀。还发现了一些染色的棉纤维、焦油状碎片、花粉粒和金属薄片。样品体积的大约10%是松散固结的纤维棉绒团块，其中最大的部分是玻璃纤维。直径小于75µm的部分的SEM分析显示，有许多玻璃纤维和水泥颗粒，其中一些呈纤维状，含有钙、硅和硫。通过透射电镜鉴定，在细粒中发现了温石棉纤维。我们在市场街样本分析的单个颗粒中没有发现含有铅、铬、镉或汞的颗粒，尽管ICP/MS分析检测到除汞外的所有颗粒。每个采集的样本之间的形态学差异很小，这可以归因于我们每个样本只分析了1000个颗粒。颗粒数量的这种限制将妨碍对占每个样品<0.1%的所有材料进行一致检测。Cortlandt Street、Market和Cherry Street样本之间的一个微小差异是，Cortlandt街样本的细颗粒（*直径<2.5µm的颗粒）含量为0.88%*，而*其他两个样本的细粒子质量为>1.1%*。使用显微镜分析来大致描述材料在质量分数中的分布，我们发现大颗粒主要由建筑材料组成，包括石膏、玻璃纤维、矿棉纤维、木纤维和纸张碎片。附着在建筑材料上的温石棉、温石棉束和石膏也是大颗粒的组成部分。这与具有纤维颗粒束的皮棉粒径在>300µm范围内的事实一致。*较小的颗粒（直径<75µm）包括石棉、烟灰、铅和其他微量元素*。这与该事件的双重性质一致——两栋建筑倒塌，覆盖着强烈燃烧的建筑——这将主要导致个人和人群暴露在大颗粒物中，而暴露在细颗粒物中的几率要低得多。然而，在最初的两天里，空气中的大量物质可能会导致未受保护的个体暴露在高水平。
	- Inorganic and metals. The concentrations of elements found in the samples are shown in Table 2, which provides values for an array of elements detectable by ICP/MS. The levels of many of the elements are consistent with their presence in building materials, including chromium, magnesium, manganese, aluminum, and barium. The very high levels of titanium (> 0.1%) were due to their presence in paint, especially white paint. The lead levels are elevated due to the use of lead-based paint on metallic surfaces during construction of the building. The detected lead dust concentrations were lower than would be found outdoors in older cities affected by tailpipe emissions from leaded gasoline (24). The lead levels, however, could not be discounted in concerns about exposure. Because of the large mass of material deposited within rehabitable buildings throughout lower Manhattan, surface loading could enhance potential nondietary exposures (25). In contrast, mercury was not at quantifiable levels, and the concentrations of arsenic and cadmium were relatively low, but in the micrograms/gram (parts per million) concentration range. In addition to the elements quantified by ICP/MS analyses, the SEM dispersive X-ray analyses showed large signals for iron and calcium, which are major components of construction materials. Similar observations were found for silicon, which is consistent with the glass fragments and fiberglass found in each sample. FTIR functional group analysis detected a signal that is indicative of calcium sulfate dihydrate, a component of gypsum board, and calcium carbonate, which is extensively used as filler for many materials. Other SEM analyses found signals of trace elements, which are indicative of fiberglass and other nonorganic fibers, especially asbestos fiber. We found detectable levels of typical anionic and cationic species that are usually measured in aerosol samples (ion chromatography results shown in Table 1). We found chloride and sulfate in all samples. The Cortlandt, Cherry, and Market Street samples had sulfate levels of 41,400, 35,200, and 42,100 ng/g, respectively, which probably were formed in the fires. We also detected calcium in the nanograms per gram concentration range; this is probably a result of the pulverization of building materials, with Cortlandt, Cherry, and Market Streets having values of 18,200, 14,000, and 17,000 ng/g, respectively. The high calcium levels are consistent with the FTIR and morphologic analyses. A major difference between these samples was that Cortlandt Street had approximately three times the levels of both fluoride and chloride as the other streets. PAHs. In the morphologic analyses, we found that the particles < 75 µm in diameter were gray. Thus, we focused the analyses on products of incomplete combustion as well as other organic species. The results for PAHs are shown in Tables 3 and 4. For the three dust and smoke samples, which were undifferentiated by particle size, the total concentrations of 40 typical PAHs with higher molecular weights were in excess of 200–300 µg/g. The distribution of the 40 PAH compounds are shown in Figure 7, with levels of individual PAHs ranging from hundreds of nanograms per gram to > 40 µg/g. Benzo[a]pyrene ranged from 12 to 24 µg/g, with the highest values detected at Cortlandt Street. The values for phenanthrene ranged from 22 to 44 µg/g, with the highest value also detected at the Cortlandt Street
	- 无机和金属。样品中发现的元素浓度如表2所示，表2提供了可通过ICP/MS检测的元素阵列的值。许多元素的含量与它们在建筑材料中的存在一致，包括铬、镁、锰、铝和钡。钛含量非常高（＞0.1%）是因为它们存在于油漆中，尤其是白色油漆中。由于在建筑施工过程中在金属表面使用了含铅涂料，*铅含量*会升高。在受含铅汽油尾气排放影响的老城市，检测到的铅尘浓度低于室外（24）。然而，在对暴露的担忧中，铅含量不能被低估。由于曼哈顿下城可居住建筑内沉积了大量材料，表面荷载可能会增加潜在的非饮食暴露（25）。相比之下，汞没有达到可量化的水平，砷和镉的浓度相对较低，但在微克/克（百万分之一）的浓度范围内。除了通过ICP/MS分析量化的元素外，SEM分散X射线分析还显示了铁和钙的大信号，这是建筑材料的主要成分。对硅也发现了类似的观察结果，这与每个样品中发现的玻璃碎片和玻璃纤维一致。FTIR官能团分析检测到一个信号，该信号表明二水硫酸钙（石膏板的一种成分）和碳酸钙（广泛用作许多材料的填料）。其他SEM分析发现了微量元素的信号，这些信号表明玻璃纤维和其他无机纤维，尤其是石棉纤维。我们发现了通常在气溶胶样品中测量的典型阴离子和阳离子物种的可检测水平（离子色谱结果如表1所示）。我们在所有样品中都发现了氯化物和硫酸盐。Cortlandt、Cherry和Market Street样本的硫酸盐含量分别为41400、35200和42100纳克/克，可能是在火灾中形成的。我们还检测到每克浓度范围内的钙；这可能是建筑材料粉碎的结果，Cortlandt、Cherry和Market Streets的值分别为18200、14000和17000纳克/克。高钙含量与FTIR和形态学分析一致。这些样本之间的一个主要差异是，Cortlandt街的氟化物和氯化物含量大约是其他街道的三倍。*PAHs*。在形态学分析中，我们发现直径小于75µm的颗粒为灰色。因此，我们重点分析了不完全燃烧的产物以及其他有机物质。PAHs的结果如表3和表4所示。对于三个未按颗粒大小区分的灰尘和烟雾样本，40种典型的高分子量多环芳烃的总浓度超过200–300µg/g。40种PAH化合物的分布如图7所示，单个PAH的水平从数百纳克/克到>40µg/g不等。苯并[a]芘的含量在12至24µg/g之间，在Cortlandt街检测到的最高值。菲的含量在22至44µg/g之间，在Cortlandt街也检测到最高值
	- PAHs. In the morphologic analyses, we found that the particles < 75 µm in diameter were gray. Thus, we focused the analyses on products of incomplete combustion as well as other organic species. The results for PAHs are shown in Tables 3 and 4. For the three dust and smoke samples, which were undifferentiated by particle size, the total concentrations of 40 typical PAHs with higher molecular weights were in excess of 200–300 µg/g. The distribution of the 40 PAH compounds are shown in Figure 7, with levels of individual PAHs ranging from hundreds of nanograms per gram to > 40 µg/g. Benzo[a]pyrene ranged from 12 to 24 µg/g, with the highest values detected at Cortlandt Street. The values for phenanthrene ranged from 22 to 44 µg/g, with the highest value also detected at the Cortlandt Street. We found other PAHs in each sample (Table 4); for example, 7H-benzo[e]fluorene and 11H-benzo[b]fluorene were found in the Market Street sample, with values of 39 ppm and 33 µg/g, respectively. Additional PAHs were detected in the Cortlandt and Cherry Street samples, although these samples had a much less diverse mix of additional PAHs and neither had detectable levels of the two compounds mentioned above. For example, the Cortlandt Street sample had two methylated phenanthrene compounds at concentrations < 10 µg/g. If we add the quantifiable PAHs in each sample, the total PAHs in the settled dust and smoke was > 0.1% of the mass. The highest concentrations of the 40 specific PAHs reported in Table 4 and Figure 7 were found in the Cortlandt Street sample. This is logical because it was the site closest to the fire after the collapse; however, a larger variety of other PAHs at concentrations > 10 µg/g were found in the Market samples. The intense and uncontrolled fire(s) would be expected to burn at different temperatures, and the homogeneity of the material that burned would lead to a variety of unburned or partially burned hydrocarbons. These were derived from burning plastics, metals, woods, synthetic products, and other materials; using morphologic analyses, we found charred wood particles in all three samples. Other organic compounds. A significant product of incomplete combustion found in all three samples was the class of contaminants called phthalate esters; as shown in Table 4, the levels were > 10 µg/g for specific compounds. The total level of detectable phthalate esters in the Market Street sample was > 100 µg/g. Hydrocarbons identified and shown in Figure 8 indicated the presence of a fuel, which in this case was associated with the approximately 91,000 L of unburned or burning jet fuel that cascaded down each building after the explosions and during the collapse of each tower. Results of all three samples showed an unresolved envelope of high boiling hydrocarbons of 10 carbons or greater and had individual compound peaks superimposed on the envelope (Figure 8). The mass spectrum of the unresolved envelope was consistent with saturated hydrocarbon chains (masses separated by 14 amu starting at 43 amu) and naphthalene ring structure (128 amu). All samples also showed major peaks of the lightest PAHs (naphthalene, substituted naphthalene, acenaphthalene, and fluorene), which were consistent with the presence of products of combustion and the quantitative results reported in Tables 3 and 4. The alkane peaks were much more pronounced and distinct in the sample collected farthest to the east of Ground Zero (0.7 km; Market Street) (Figure 8). The alkanes detected were the same as those found in uncombusted fuel. Jet fuel is composed of a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons (representing > 50% of the total fuel) and aromatic hydrocarbons (26). Paraffins and cycloparaffins in the C9–C16 range dominate the composition. Gas chromatograms of the vapor phase of jet fuel show both the unresolved envelope and individual hydrocarbon peaks of the straight chain pariffins observed in the thermal desorption profile from the collected dust sample (27). The additional peaks identified within the dust samples represent PAHs that resulted from the incomplete combustion of the building material, the jet fuel from the planes after the explosion and fire, and the collapse of both of the World Trade Center towers. The results suggest that particles transported away from the site during the initial conflagration contained a mixture of combustion products and jet fuel. Thus, residents downwind during the initial hours would have been exposed to particles from construction debris, products of incomplete combustion, and some coated with jet fuel. Other materials could have shown similar patterns, but the large amount of jet fuel released during the crashes would have overwhelmed contributions from other materials such as fuel oil and other petroleum-based products.
	- *PAHs*。多环芳香烃（PAHs）（Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons）.  在形态学分析中，我们发现直径小于75µm的颗粒为灰色。因此，我们重点分析了不完全燃烧的产物以及其他有机物质。PAHs的结果如表3和表4所示。对于三个未按颗粒大小区分的灰尘和烟雾样本，40种典型的高分子量多环芳烃的总浓度超过200–300µg/g。40种PAH化合物的分布如图7所示，单个PAH的水平从数百纳克/克到>40µg/g不等。苯并[a]芘的含量在12至24µg/g之间，在Cortlandt街检测到的最高值。菲的含量在22至44µg/g之间，在Cortlandt街也检测到最高值。我们在每个样品中发现了其他多环芳烃（表4）；例如，在市场街样品中发现7H-苯并[e]芴和11H-苯并[b]芴，其值分别为39 ppm和33µg/g。在Cortlandt和Cherry Street的样本中检测到了额外的多环芳烃，尽管这些样本的额外多环芳烃混合物的多样性要低得多，而且都没有检测到上述两种化合物的水平。例如，Cortlandt Street样品中有两种浓度<10µg/g的甲基化菲化合物。如果我们加上每个样本中可量化的多环芳烃，则沉降的灰尘和烟雾中的总多环芳烃大于质量的0.1%。表4和图7中报告的40种特定多环芳烃的最高浓度是在Cortlandt Street样本中发现的。这是合乎逻辑的，因为它是坍塌后离火灾最近的地点；然而，在市场样品中发现了浓度>10µg/g的多种其他多环芳烃。强烈和不受控制的火灾预计将在不同的温度下燃烧，燃烧材料的均匀性将导致各种未燃烧或部分燃烧的碳氢化合物。这些来源于燃烧塑料、金属、木材、合成产品和其他材料；通过形态学分析，我们在三个样品中都发现了烧焦的木材颗粒。其他有机化合物。在所有三个样品中发现的不完全燃烧的一个重要产物是一类被称为邻苯二甲酸酯的污染物；如表4所示，特定化合物的水平>10µg/g。市场街样本中可检测到的邻苯二甲酸酯的总含量>100µg/g。图8中确定和显示的碳氢化合物表明存在燃料，在这种情况下，燃料与爆炸后和每座塔倒塌期间从每座建筑倾泻而下的约91000升未燃烧或燃烧的喷气燃料有关。所有三个样品的结果都显示了10个碳或更多的高沸点碳氢化合物的未解析包络，并且包络上叠加了单独的化合物峰（图8）。未解析包络的质谱与饱和烃链（质量从43amu开始分离14amu）和萘环结构（128amu）一致。所有样品还显示出最轻PAHs（萘、取代萘、并萘和芴）的主峰，这与燃烧产物的存在以及表3和表4中报告的定量结果一致。在零点以东（0.7公里；市场街）采集的样品中，烷烃峰更加明显和明显（图8）。检测到的烷烃与未燃烧燃料中发现的烷烃相同。喷气燃料由饱和烃（占总燃料的50%以上）和芳烃（26）的混合物组成。C9–C16范围内的石蜡和环石蜡在组成中占主导地位。喷气燃料气相的气相色谱图显示了从收集的灰尘样品（27）的热解吸剖面中观察到的直链石蜡的未解析包络和单个碳氢化合物峰。灰尘样本中发现的额外峰值代表了建筑材料的不完全燃烧、爆炸和火灾后飞机上的喷气燃料以及世贸中心两座大楼的倒塌所产生的多环芳烃。结果表明，在最初的大火中，从现场运走的颗粒物含有燃烧产物和喷气燃料的混合物。因此，在最初的几个小时里，顺风的居民会暴露在建筑碎片、不完全燃烧产物和一些涂有喷气燃料的颗粒中。其他材料也可能表现出类似的模式，但坠机期间释放的大量喷气燃料将超过燃油和其他石油产品等其他材料的贡献。
	- The levels of PCBs and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-diozins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were in the nanograms per gram and picograms per gram range as shown in Tables 3 and 5, respectively. Thus, the situation yielded detectable, but not excessive, levels of these categories of environmental contaminants. The toxic equivalent values for PCDDs and PCDFs in dust (approximately 100 ng/kg) in this study were consistent with those of dust sampled directly from the pile (maximum total equivalents of about 300 ng/kg) (28). Neither our study nor the U.S. EPA found PCDD levels in dust above background (29). The levels of polybrominated biphenyls and brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) were also determined (Table 6) and were similar to levels found in sewage sludge (30). The penta-mixture (BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-100) is used in flame retardants for polyurethane foam, which is common as padding in office furniture. The highest concentration was for BDE-209, which is present in thermoplastics (e.g., computers). However, the large volume of material present would lead to significant ambient levels of polybrominated biphenyls, BDEs, and other materials during the first day after the attack on the WTC. We found no concentrations above background for the pesticide chlordane.
	- 如表3和表5所示，*多氯联苯和多氯二苯*并对二恶英以及二苯并呋喃的含量分别在纳克/克和皮克/克范围内。因此，这种情况产生了可检测但不过量的这些类别的环境污染物。本研究中粉尘中多氯二苯并对二恶英和多氯二呋喃的毒性当量（约100纳克/公斤）与直接从堆中取样的粉尘的毒性当量一致（最大总当量约为300纳克/千克）（28）。我们的研究和美国环保局都没有发现灰尘中的多氯二苯并二恶英含量高于本底（29）。还测定了多溴联苯和溴化二苯醚的含量（表6），与污水污泥中的含量相似（30）。五元混合物（BDE-47、BDE-99和BDE-100）用于聚氨酯泡沫的阻燃剂，聚氨酯泡沫是办公家具中常见的填充物。BDE-209的浓度最高，它存在于热塑性塑料（如计算机）中。然而，在WTC遭到袭击后的第一天，大量材料的存在将导致多溴联苯、二溴二苯醚和其他材料的环境水平显著升高。我们没有发现杀虫剂氯丹的浓度高于本底。
	- The composition of each sample collected from the three locations east of the WTC site were complex because of the dual nature of the released aerosol and the magnitude of the event. The aerosol that was released and deposited on surfaces downwind of the complex included pulverized building debris and products of incomplete combustion produced by the explosion that ignited the thousands of liters of jet fuel. The mass of material deposited was extremely high and, in many indoor locations, the deposited particle loadings were 1–3 cm thick (Figure 9). In outdoor situations, the dust and smoke loadings sometimes reached a thickness of > 10 cm. Thus, on the first and second days after the attack on the WTC, > 70% of the mass was associated with construction materials, including pulverized cement, wallboard, and office furnishings, which included a large percentage by weight of glass fiber. A small percentage of the carcinogen asbestos was found in these samples (≈0.8% by volume), although some individual samples yielded higher levels. The products of incomplete combustion were produced by the intense fire that consumed many materials in the buildings (e.g., furnishings, equipment, debris, wiring, metal, wood, etc.). PAHs, products of incomplete combustion, were present in the samples at levels of 5 µg/g to hundreds of micrograms per gram. Concentrations of the individual compounds (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene) were > 20 µg/g, and the total mass of PAHs present were in excess of 0.1% of the mass. When placed in the context of the vast amounts of other materials present in the air during the first day after the collapse and fires, these levels were high and could lead to significant short-term inhalation exposure. In fact, based on the PAH results obtained from air samples after 25 September, the types of PAHs released into the atmosphere at that time were similar to the PAHs detected in the settled dust and smoke samples collected during the first week after the collapse and fires (29). The levels of PCDDs and PCDFs were similar to those found in other studies (29), but the levels of 2,2´,4,4´,5,5´-hexabromobiphenyl were higher than those found in sludge, which is likely due to its use during the construction of the WTC in the 1970s (30). The concentrations of lead ranged from 100 to > 600 ppm; these concentrations are not very high compared to the levels found in typical urban soils. However, the actual levels of dust and smoke deposited in individual buildings and businesses need to be assessed for cleanup based on the actual surface loading of lead and asbestos. A systematic effort will be required to properly clean indoor locations in order to eliminate persistent levels of lead, asbestos, and other hazardous materials on surfaces and in the air ducts that service each residence or building (air ducts can be a reservoir of material that could be released into the indoor air if not properly cleaned).
	- 由于释放的气溶胶的双重性质和事件的严重性，从WTC现场以东的三个地点收集的每个样本的成分都很复杂。释放并沉积在综合体下风表面的气溶胶包括粉碎的建筑碎片和点燃数千升喷气燃料的爆炸产生的不完全燃烧产物。沉积的材料质量极高，在许多室内位置，沉积的颗粒载荷为1-3厘米厚（图9）。在室外情况下，灰尘和烟雾荷载有时达到>10cm的厚度。因此，在世贸中心遭到袭击后的第一天和第二天，>70%的质量与建筑材料有关，包括粉碎的水泥、墙板和办公家具，其中包括很大比例的玻璃纤维。在这些样品中发现了一小部分致癌物石棉（≈0.8%体积），尽管一些单独的样品产生了更高的水平。不完全燃烧的产物是由大火产生的，大火消耗了建筑物中的许多材料（如家具、设备、碎片、电线、金属、木材等）。不完全燃烧产物PAHs在样品中的含量为每克5微克至数百微克。单个化合物（如苯并[a]芘）的浓度>20µg/g，存在的PAHs总质量超过质量的0.1%。当将其放在坍塌和火灾后第一天空气中存在的大量其他物质的背景下时，这些水平很高，可能导致严重的短期吸入暴露。事实上，根据9月25日之后从空气样本中获得的多环芳烃结果，当时释放到大气中的多环芳烃类型与坍塌和火灾后第一周收集的沉降灰尘和烟雾样本中检测到的多环芳烃相似（29）。PCDDs和PCDFs的含量与其他研究中发现的含量相似（29），但2,2´、4,4´、5,5´-六溴联苯的含量高于污泥中发现的水平，这可能是由于其在20世纪70年代WTC建设期间的使用（30）。铅的浓度范围为100至>600 ppm；与典型城市土壤中的浓度相比，这些浓度并不是很高。然而，需要根据铅和石棉的实际表面负荷来评估个别建筑和企业中沉积的灰尘和烟雾的实际水平，以便进行清理。需要系统地努力适当清洁室内位置，以消除每个住宅或建筑物表面和风管中的铅、石棉和其他有害物质的持续水平（风管可能是一个材料库，如果不适当清洁，可能会释放到室内空气中）。
	- The high pH of the samples was probably caused by cement and other basic materials associated with construction debris in the deposited particles. This factor, along with the presence of long and thin glass fibers (nonasbestos) and attached agglomerated fine particles, must be considered when evaluating the initial lung irritations reported by residents and workers in the initial days and weeks after the collapse of the WTC buildings. The rain on 15 September and especially the heavy rains that fell on 24 September washed away much of the material from outdoor surfaces. However, because of the extremely dry weather pattern in the Northeast during fall 2001, dust still remained on some outdoor surfaces and rooftops through November. The WTC site itself was continually sprayed with water to keep the resuspendable dust levels down during recovery operations. The persistence of significant levels of the initial dust and smoke into the late fall were also associated with indoor locations, including buildings that had open ventilation systems or open windows at the time of the collapse, or had windows blown out during the collapse. The quantities of settled and resuspendable dust and smoke are of concern indoors. WTC dust and smoke could lead to health impacts if the toxic constituents present on the indoor surfaces are not cleaned properly and if the HVAC system of each structure is not concurrently cleaned, or cleaned before the cleanup of the indoor surfaces and reentry into the residence or office. The U.S. EPA and other organizations have repeatedly recommended using methods for removal of hazardous materials in residences and offices before rehabitation. This approach to cleanup is necessary to ensure that rehabitation clearance values are achieved for contaminants such as lead (i.e., 40 µg/ft2 on floors) (31). Some types of material that were released are similar to materials that we are exposed to during our daily lives. At a minimum, however, extraordinarily high quantities of coarse and fine particles were released and dispersed after the WTC collapse; future analysis is needed on the health consequences of the exposure among commuters, workers, and residents. The differences in the three samples that we analyzed suggest that there were inhomogenities among aerosol materials released on 11 September and during the subsequent weeks. This is expected because of the large amounts of different materials present in each of the collapsed and burning structures. The outdoor cleanup of the initially deposited material began days after the attack and continued for several months. The indoor cleanup activities have proceeded more slowly. Eventually, estimates of human exposure to the materials characterized in these three bulk samples will be made. In addition, the results for composition and particle size, with and without agglomerates on glass fiber and other fibrous particles, will be used in assessments of short-term and longterm effects among various populations including sensitive subgroups. The people potentially exposed to the initially suspended dust and smoke, or subsequently settled dust and smoke, would include unprotected rescue workers, residents, and workers in downtown Manhattan immediately after and in the first few weeks after the collapse. The settled dust and smoke could be resuspended and expose unprotected residential cleanup workers and workers and residents in poorly or inefficiently cleaned buildings for weeks to months after 11 September. Finally, the levels of exposure encountered will have to be placed into context with the materials that have been released from the diminishing smoldering fires that continued to burn until 14 December 2001
	- 样品的高pH值可能是由沉积颗粒中与建筑碎片相关的水泥和其他基本材料引起的。在评估WTC建筑倒塌后最初几天和几周内居民和工人报告的最初肺部刺激时，必须考虑这一因素，以及细长玻璃纤维（非石棉）和附着的团聚细颗粒的存在。9月15日的降雨，特别是9月24日的暴雨，冲走了室外表面的大部分材料。然而，由于2001年秋季东北部的极端干燥天气模式，灰尘仍然留在一些室外表面和屋顶上，直到11月。WTC现场本身不断喷水，以在回收操作期间降低可再悬浮的灰尘水平。最初的大量灰尘和烟雾持续到深秋也与室内位置有关，包括倒塌时通风系统打开或窗户打开的建筑物，或倒塌期间窗户被吹出的建筑物。室内沉降和可再悬浮的灰尘和烟雾的数量令人担忧。如果室内表面存在的有毒成分没有得到正确清洁，如果每个结构的暖通空调系统没有同时清洁，或者在室内表面清洁和重新进入住宅或办公室之前没有清洁，WTC灰尘和烟雾可能会对健康造成影响。美国环保局和其他组织多次建议在重新安置前使用清除住宅和办公室有害物质的方法。这种清理方法是必要的，以确保达到铅等污染物的重新居住许可值（即地板上的40µg/ft2）（31）。释放的某些类型的材料与我们日常生活中接触到的材料相似。然而，在WTC坍塌后，至少释放和分散了大量的粗颗粒和细颗粒；未来需要对通勤者、工人和居民的接触对健康的影响进行分析。我们分析的三个样本的差异表明，9月11日和随后几周释放的气溶胶物质存在不均匀性。这是意料之中的，因为每个坍塌和燃烧的结构中都存在大量不同的材料。最初沉积的材料在袭击发生几天后开始进行户外清理，并持续了几个月。室内清理活动进展缓慢。最终，将对人类接触这三个大样本中特征材料的情况进行估计。此外，玻璃纤维和其他纤维颗粒上有无团聚体的成分和颗粒尺寸的结果将用于评估包括敏感亚组在内的各种人群的短期和长期影响。可能暴露在最初悬浮的灰尘和烟雾中，或随后沉降的灰尘和烟中的人，包括未受保护的救援人员、居民，以及坍塌后立即和最初几周在曼哈顿市中心的工作人员。沉降的灰尘和烟雾可能会被重新悬浮，并在9月11日之后的数周至数月内暴露在未受保护的住宅清洁工人、清洁不力或效率低下的建筑物中的工人和居民身上。最后，必须将所遇到的暴露程度与从持续燃烧到2001年12月14日的逐渐减少的阴燃火灾中释放出的材料联系起来

- Abstract
	- The World Trade Center (WTC) twin towers in New York City collapsed on 9/11/2001, converting much of the buildings’ huge masses into dense dust clouds of particles that settled on the streets and within buildings throughout Lower Manhattan. About 80–90% of the settled WTC Dust, ranging in particle size from ~2.5 μm upward, was a highly alkaline mixture of crushed concrete, gypsum, and synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs) that was readily resuspendable by physical disturbance and low-velocity air currents. High concentrations of coarse and supercoarse WTC Dust were inhaled and deposited in the conductive airways in the head and lungs, and subsequently swallowed, causing both physical and chemical irritation to the respiratory and gastroesophageal epithelia. There were both acute and chronic adverse health effects in rescue/ recovery workers; cleanup workers; residents; and office workers, especially in those lacking effective personal respiratory protective equipment. The numerous health effects in these people were not those associated with the monitored PM2.5 toxicants, which were present at low concentrations, that is, asbestos fibers, transition and heavy metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs, and dioxins. Attention was never directed at the very high concentrations of the largersized and highly alkaline WTC Dust particles that, in retrospect, contained the more likely causal toxicants. Unfortunately, the initial focus of the air quality monitoring and guidance on exposure prevention programs on low-concentration components was never revised. Public agencies need to be better prepared to provide reliable guidance to the public on more appropriate means of exposure assessment, risk assessment, and preventive measures.
	- 2001年9月11日，纽约市的世界贸易中心（WTC）双塔倒塌，将大部分建筑的巨大质量转化为密集的颗粒尘埃云，沉积在整个曼哈顿下城的街道和建筑内。约80-90%的沉降WTC粉尘，粒径约为2.5μm以上，是由碎混凝土、石膏和合成玻璃纤维（SVF）组成的高碱性混合物，可通过物理扰动和低速气流进行再悬浮。高浓度的粗颗粒和超硬颗粒WTC粉尘被吸入并沉积在头部和肺部的导电气道中，随后被吞咽，对呼吸和胃食管上皮造成物理和化学刺激。救援/康复人员的健康既有急性不良影响，也有慢性不良影响；清理工人；居民；以及办公室工作人员，尤其是那些缺乏有效个人呼吸防护设备的人。这些人的许多健康影响与监测到的PM2.5有毒物质无关，这些有毒物质以低浓度存在，即石棉纤维、过渡金属和重金属、多环芳烃或多环芳烃以及二恶英。人们从来没有关注过浓度非常高的大型和高碱性WTC粉尘颗粒，回想起来，这些颗粒含有更可能的致癌物质。不幸的是，空气质量监测和低浓度成分暴露预防计划指导的最初重点从未修订。公共机构需要做好更好的准备，就更适当的暴露评估、风险评估和预防措施向公众提供可靠的指导。
- Introduction
	- The lead author has been engaged in his semi-retirement in scientific recapitulation on environmental health topics of 1) his long-term interests; 2) substantial impacts in terms of public health and concern; and 3) continuing concern and confusion in 1) the scientific literature; 2) among the regulatory agencies; and 3) the public. His two recent recapitulations, published in this journal, addressed 1) toxicological and epidemiological studies of effects of the cardiovascular effects of ambient air fine particulate matter (PM; PM2.5) and its chemical components (Lippmann 2014a); and 2) toxicological and epidemiological studies of effects of airborne fibers (Lippmann 2014b). This paper, providing a holistic reappraisal on the health impacts of inhalation exposures to dust created by the collapses of the World Trade Center (WTC) twin towers on September 11, 2001, reappraises the work of many investigators, including the pioneering contributions of its coauthors, on the characterization, toxicology, and health effects of inhaled WTC Dusts. While the lead author did not get personally involved until 2014, he, like many other environmental health researchers, was surprised to see the emerging evidence in the literature that demonstrated substantial health impacts among populations exposed to WTC Dusts in Lower Manhattan. His initial doubts about major public health impacts derived from his expectation that the inhaled doses of long chrysotile asbestos fibers and of other trace-level components in the fine PM (PM2.5) would be too small to produce measurable effects. Furthermore, he did not anticipate the unique aspects of the initial airborne dust cloud, and its ==subsequent resuspensions from the settled dust layers==, in terms of 1) overall mass concentrations and 2) the dominance by coarse-sized particles in terms of a) alkalinity and b) high concentrations of crushed synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs), cement, and gypsum. Finally, the initial paucity of toxicological literature on dusts having such characteristics made it difficult to envision, in advance, the toxic effects.
	- 主要作者半退休时一直从事环境健康主题的科学重述：1）他的长期利益；2） 对公众健康和关注的重大影响；（3）科学文献中的持续关注和困惑；2） 监管机构之间；以及3）公众。他最近发表在本杂志上的两篇综述涉及1）环境空气细颗粒物（PM；PM2.5）及其化学成分对心血管影响的毒理学和流行病学研究（Lippmann 2014a）；以及2）空气中纤维影响的毒理学和流行病学研究（Lippmann 2014b）。本文对2001年9月11日世界贸易中心双塔倒塌造成的吸入性粉尘对健康的影响进行了全面的重新评估，重新评估了许多研究人员的工作，包括其合著者在吸入的世界贸易中心粉尘的特征、毒理学和健康影响方面的开创性贡献。虽然主要作者直到2014年才亲自参与，但他和许多其他环境健康研究人员一样，惊讶地看到文献中出现的证据表明，曼哈顿下城接触WTC粉尘的人群对健康产生了重大影响。他最初对重大公共健康影响的怀疑源于他的预期，即细颗粒物（PM2.5）中长温石棉纤维和其他微量成分的吸入剂量太小，无法产生可衡量的影响。此外，就1）总质量浓度和2）粗粒径颗粒在a）碱度和b）高浓度粉碎的合成玻璃纤维（SVF）、水泥和石膏方面的优势而言，他没有预料到最初空气中的尘埃云及其随后从沉降的灰尘层中重悬浮的独特方面。最后，由于最初缺乏关于具有这种特征的粉尘的毒理学文献，因此很难提前设想其毒性作用。
- WTC dust
	- Any adult alive today has a vivid memory of the morning of September 11, 2001, when there were impacts of two commercial airliners on the North and South Towers of the WTC in New York City (NYC). Both towers collapsed within the next few hours, and dense clouds of dust spread throughout the southern end of Manhattan Island. The bulk (about 80– 90%) of the WTC Dust was generated by the successive collisions of the concrete floor slabs of the 110-story towers as they cascaded down on each lower floor, crushing the concrete, the gypsum (calcium sulfate) wallboard, and the glass- and slag-wool insulation fibers (SVFs) into a finely divided mixed powder with aerodynamic diameters ranging upward from about 2.5 micrometers (μm). The dust layers on the streets/sidewalks of Lower Manhattan (Figure 1A), and within buildings with shattered or open windows (Figure 1B) could be inches thick in the closest nearby buildings; these dusts could be readily resuspended by air currents or mechanical disturbance during the subsequent cleanup activities by 1) rescue and recovery workers and volunteers on the debris pile at what became known as Ground Zero; 2) cleanup workers for streets and building exteriors; 3) indoor cleanup workers; 4) residents (of all ages); 5) office workers; and 6) other workers within commercial buildings.

	- Gregory Meeker of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a participant in the early dust collection and analyses, was quoted in Chemical and Engineering News (10/20/2003) as saying “Six million ft2 of masonry, 5 million ft2 of painted surfaces, 7 million ft2 of flooring, 600,000 ft2 of window glass, 200 elevators, and everything inside came down as dust when the towers collapsed.” The dust generated by the collapse of the WTC towers, hereafter designated herein as “WTC Dust,” was unique in terms of its particle size distribution, especially in terms of its lower and upper ends. Of the total mass in the settled WTC Dust, < 1% was in the fine size range (< 2.5 in aerodynamic diameter), and > 90% was between 2.5 and 100 μm (Lioy et al. 2002, 2006, McGee et al. 2003, Yiin et al. 2006) (Figure 2), and when resuspended by Vaughan et al. (2014) for an animal inhalation study, the dust had a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 23 μm. Thus, virtually all of the WTC settled dust was in the coarse particle size range, and differed in sources and composition from those of fine particles, as shown in Table 1. In the more humid Eastern US, most of the ambient PM is usually smaller than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), originates from both organic and inorganic vapor-phase pollutants, and is carbonaceous and/or acidic and hydroscopic. Most of the fine particles penetrate through the lung conductive airways to reach the gas exchange airways in the deep lung. In the more arid parts of the Western US, there are often more equal coarse PM mass concentrations of particles between 2.5 and 10 μm as of PM2.5. Most particles in the 2.5–10 μm range penetrate into the conductive airways within the human and deposit in the larger lung airways. Supercoarse particles, that is, those larger than 10 μm, have high deposition efficiencies in the upper respiratory tract (URT), but can still have appreciable penetration into, and deposition within the lungs when the airborne concentrations are high, as they were of coarse and supercoarse WTC Dust in Lower Manhattan on and after 9/11/2001. We are rarely exposed to dusts such as WTC Dust (Lioy et al. 2002, McGee et al. 2003, Yiin et al. 2006), with MMAD of 23 μm (Vaughan et al. 2014), in a form that could be resuspended by gusts of air or mechanical disturbance (McGee et al. 2003, Lee 2014). Further, WTC Dust differed substantially from typical dusts found within building construction and demolition sites, where the debris is generally composed of much larger pieces that cannot be readily resuspended into the air, or rapidly dissolved in the aqueous surface fluids of the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. The WTC Dust was also unique in terms of its more uniform chemical composition, with 80–90% of it being a well-blended mixture of nearly equal parts of concrete, gypsum, and SVFs. Further, the WTC Dust was also unique in terms of its geographic extent of spatial dispersion, both outdoors and indoors. Pressure waves created by the collapses of the WTC Towers created hurricane-like winds that radiated out from the WTC Towers (Ground Zero; Figure 3) through the urban street canyons of Lower Manhattan, with relatively little WTC Dust reaching beyond Canal Street to the north in Manhattan or beyond the nearest parts of Brooklyn.
	- 美国地质调查局的Gregory Meeker是早期灰尘收集和分析的参与者，《化学与工程新闻》（2003年10月20日）援引他的话说：“600万平方英尺的砖石、500万平方英尺油漆表面、700万平方英尺地板、60万平方英尺窗户玻璃、200部电梯，当塔楼倒塌时，里面的一切都变成了灰尘。“WTC塔倒塌产生的灰尘，下文称为“WTC灰尘”，其粒度分布是独特的，尤其是其下端和上端。在沉降的WTC粉尘的总质量中，*<1%在细粒度范围内（空气动力学直径<2.5）*，>90%在2.5和100μm之间（Lioy等人，20022006，McGee等人，2003，Yiin等人，2006）（图2），当Vaughan等人（2014）对动物吸入研究进行重悬时，粉尘的质量中值空气动力学直径（MMAD）为23μm。因此，几乎所有WTC沉降的灰尘都在粗颗粒尺寸范围内，并且在来源和组成上与细颗粒不同，如表1所示。在更潮湿的美国东部，大多数环境PM的空气动力学直径（PM2.5）通常小于2.5μm，来源于有机和无机气相污染物，并且是碳质和/或酸性和吸湿性的。大多数细颗粒穿透肺传导气道，到达肺深部的气体交换气道。在美国西部更干旱的地区，与PM2.5相比，颗粒物的粗颗粒物质量浓度通常在2.5至10μm之间。2.5–10μm范围内的大多数颗粒会穿透人体内的导电气道，并沉积在较大的肺气道中。超级浆状颗粒，即大于10μm的颗粒，在上呼吸道（URT）中具有很高的沉积效率，但当空气中的浓度高时，它们仍然可以明显地渗透到肺部，并在肺部沉积，就像2001年9月11日及之后曼哈顿下城的粗颗粒和超级颗粒WTC粉尘一样。我们很少接触到WTC粉尘（Lioy等人，2002年，McGee等人，2003年，Yiin等人，2006年），MMAD为23μm（Vaughan等人，2014年），其*形式可以通过阵风或机械干扰重新悬浮*（McGee等人2003年，Lee 2014年）。此外，WTC粉尘与建筑施工和拆除现场发现的典型粉尘有很大不同，在建筑施工和拆卸现场，碎片通常由更大的碎片组成，这些碎片无法轻易再悬浮到空气中，或快速溶解在呼吸道和/或胃肠道（GI）的水性表面流体中。*WTC粉尘在其更均匀的化学成分方面也是独特的，其中80-90%是由几乎相同比例的混凝土、石膏和SVF混合而成的良好混合物*。此外，WTC Dust在空间分散的地理范围方面也是独一无二的，无论是在室外还是室内。世贸中心大楼倒塌产生的压力波产生了飓风般的风，从世贸中心大楼（归零地；图3）穿过曼哈顿下城的城市街道峡谷向外辐射，相对较少的世贸中心灰尘到达曼哈顿北部运河街以外或布鲁克林最近的地区。
	- WTC Dust was formed on the morning of 9/11/2001, a day with an unusually low humidity. However, the potential for airborne resuspension of settled WTC primary dust deposits was quite different for the outdoor and indoor deposits, especially after September 14 and 24, when there were heavy rains. These and subsequent rains washed a lot of the outdoor WTC Dust into the storm sewers leading to the Upper New York Bay to the south, and to the Hudson and East Rivers. The WTC destruction on 9/11 exposed commercial buildings within ~1,000 feet of the twin Towers (One WTC and Two WTC, as shown in sampling sites denoted in Figure 3) to high levels of dust, dirt, and debris, including toxic contaminants. This WTC Dust, as suggested by Chatfield and Kominsky (2001), was unique in its propensity to become airborne, even under “passive conditions.” In 2003, the RJ Lee Group (Lee 2014) undertook a study to investigate 1) the relationship between surface and airborne concentrations and to evaluate the potential for WTC Dust and WTC Hazardous Substances to be resuspended as a result of building maintenance activities in a heavily damaged building that was located near the former Towers on Liberty Street, and 2) the potential for unremediated or insufficiently remediated WTC Dust and WTC Hazardous Substances that had become attached to the WTC Dust, to become easily resuspended. They used low-velocity air pulses to resuspend dust from a variety of WTC Dust contaminated indoor surfaces into a portable vertical elutriator. Tests were conducted on concrete floors, ceiling tiles, fireproofing materials, floors and carpets, induction unit covers, and office equipment. The elutriator was sealed to the test surface with weather stripping, and used to resuspend, separate, and collect the dust particles that were resuspended from the surfaces. A standardized pulse of air 8 miles/h (mph) was used, a velocity ~1/20 was used in aggressive air leaf-blower test employed during asbestos cleanups, and within the range encountered during normal office building activities. The dust particles were collected on preweighed polycarbonate filters and analyzed by standard laboratory methods. The key findings of Lee (2014) were
	- WTC尘埃形成于2001年9月11日上午，这一天湿度异常低。然而，对于室外和室内沉积物，沉降的WTC初级粉尘沉积物的空气再悬浮潜力大不相同，尤其是在9月14日和24日之后，当时有暴雨。这些和随后的降雨将大量室外WTC灰尘冲入雨水下水道，雨水下水道通向南部的上纽约湾，以及哈德逊河和东河。9/11世贸中心的破坏使双塔（一座世贸中心和两座世贸中心，如图3所示的采样点）约1000英尺范围内的商业建筑暴露在高水平的灰尘、污垢和碎片中，包括有毒污染物。正如查特菲尔德（Chatfield）和科明斯基（Kominsky）（2001）所建议的那样，这种WTC尘埃具有独特的空气传播倾向，即使在“被动条件下”也是如此。2003年，RJ Lee集团（Lee，2014）进行了一项研究，以调查1）地表和空气中浓度之间的关系，并评估WTC灰尘和WTC有害物质因位于自由街前塔楼附近的*严重受损建筑的建筑维护活动而重新悬浮*的可能性，和2）未经处理或补救不足的WTC粉尘和附着在WTC粉尘上的WTC有害物质变得容易再悬浮的可能性。他们使用低速空气脉冲将各种WTC灰尘污染的室内表面的灰尘重新悬浮到便携式垂直淘析器中。对混凝土地板、天花板瓷砖、防火材料、地板和地毯、感应装置盖和办公设备进行了测试。将淘析器用耐候剥离密封在试验表面，并用于重新悬浮、分离和收集从表面重新悬浮的灰尘颗粒。使用了8英里/小时（英里/小时）的标准化空气脉冲，在石棉清理过程中使用的强力吹叶机测试中使用了约1/20的速度，并且在正常办公楼活动中遇到的范围内。在预称重的聚碳酸酯过滤器上收集灰尘颗粒，并通过标准实验室方法进行分析。Lee（2014）的主要发现是
	- • ==Resuspended dust was identified as WTC Dust in 75% of the sample locations==; • > 98% of resuspended PM collected by the elutriator was 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter; • Average lead (Pb) concentration in resuspended dust from the surface was 4.90 μg/m3; with the maximum being 42.8 μg/m3; • Average Pb levels increased in direct proportion with average surface wipe Pb concentrations; the correlation coefficient between the airborne respirable Pb and surface Pb being 0.99; • The propensity of WTC Dust to aerosolize was 10–10,000 times or more than that of ordinary office building surface dust; • Aerosolized WTC Dust contained significant quantities of respirable asbestos and Pb particles, as well as other WTC Hazardous Substances; • There was a predictable relationship between airborne and surface concentrations of asbestos, Pb, and dust in the building. Even in spaces where the surface dust was agitated by minimal activity, there was a predictable relationship between airborne asbestos levels and surface dust loading; • Asbestos, Pb, and beryllium (Be) concentrations in resuspended dust increased as a function of surface contamination levels, and, in these tests, respirable asbestos concentrations in the resuspended dust were 10–1,000 times higher than airborne asbestos concentrations in homes containing damaged asbestos-containing materials (ACM), and 100–10,000 times higher than airborne concentrations in public buildings containing at least one area of damaged ACM.
	- •在75%的样本位置，回收的灰尘被确定为WTC灰尘；•>淘析器收集的98%的再悬浮PM的空气动力学直径为10μm；•表面再悬浮粉尘中铅（Pb）的平均浓度为4.90μg/m3；最大为42.8μg/m3；•平均铅含量的增加与平均表面擦拭铅浓度成正比；空气中可吸入Pb与地表Pb的相关系数为0.99；•WTC粉尘的雾化倾向是普通办公楼表面粉尘的10–10000倍或更多；•雾化WTC粉尘含有大量可吸入的石棉和铅颗粒，以及其他WTC有害物质；•建筑中空气中石棉、铅和灰尘的浓度与表面浓度之间存在可预测的关系。即使在表面灰尘被最小活动搅动的空间中，空气中的石棉水平和表面灰尘负荷之间也存在可预测的关系；•再悬浮灰尘中的石棉、铅和铍（Be）浓度随着表面污染水平的增加而增加，在这些测试中，再悬浮灰尘的可呼吸石棉浓度是含有受损含石棉材料（ACM）的家庭中空气中石棉浓度的10-1000倍，并且比至少含有一个受损ACM区域的公共建筑中的空气浓度高100–10000倍。
	- Thus, the RJ Lee Group’s study (Lee 2014) demonstrated that WTC Dust and WTC Hazardous Substances were resuspended into the air given a minimal amount of air movement. This meant that any WTC Dust and WTC Hazardous Substances remaining in a building, even in inaccessible areas, had the potential to be resuspended and to recontaminate occupied areas of a building that had been remediated. In summary, the unique propensity of WTC Dust to be easily resuspended, relative to other building dust bearing ACM, was demonstrated by directly relating resuspended asbestos fibers in air and asbestos fibers in the surface dust. Both building maintenance activities and aggressive air tests resulted in the resuspension of WTC Dust and WTC Hazardous Substances from indoor surfaces into the air, evidenced by elevations in air levels of asbestos, Pb, and Be. Other studies performed in the building showed that the presence of WTC Dust reservoirs after professional abatement and WTC Dust in inaccessible areas recontaminate remediated areas and/or occupied spaces. Given the unique propensity of WTC Dusts to be easily resuspended, as demonstrated by this study, WTC Dust in the reservoirs of unremediated or incompletely remediated areas more likely than not became resuspended and recontaminated occupied spaces. In addition, the ready resuspension of settled WTC Dust can also enhance the dose inhaled by people engaged in the cleanup of workplaces and residences whose clothing becomes contaminated. Cohen et al. (1984) demonstrated that the concentration of dust in the breathing zone of industrial workers wearing protective clothing was significantly higher than in the air outside the breathing zone, and especially for those on the worksites who were engaged in vigorous physical activity.
	- 因此，RJ Lee集团的研究（Lee 2014）表明，*在空气运动量最小的情况下，WTC粉尘和WTC有害物质被重新悬浮在空气中*。这意味着，建筑物中残留的任何WTC粉尘和WTC有害物质，即使是在无法进入的区域，也有可能被重新悬浮，并对已修复的建筑物的占用区域进行重新污染。总之，*与其他含ACM的建筑粉尘相比，WTC粉尘易于再悬浮的独特倾向，通过直接关联空气中再悬浮的石棉纤维和表面粉尘中的石棉纤维来证明*。建筑维护活动和侵蚀性空气测试都导致WTC灰尘和WTC有害物质从室内表面重新悬浮到空气中，石棉、Pb和Be的空气水平升高证明了这一点。在该建筑中进行的其他研究表明，经过专业治理后，WTC储尘器的存在和无法进入区域的WTC粉尘的存在重新污染了修复区域和/或占用空间。鉴于WTC粉尘易于再悬浮的独特倾向，如本研究所示，未经处理或未完全修复区域的蓄水池中的WTC粉尘更有可能成为再悬浮和再污染的占用空间。此外，沉降的WTC粉尘的即时再悬浮也可以增加从事工作场所和住所清洁工作的人员吸入的剂量，因为他们的衣服被污染了。Cohen等人（1984）证明，穿着防护服的工业工人呼吸区内的灰尘浓度明显高于呼吸区外的空气中的灰尘浓度，尤其是那些在工地上从事剧烈体力活动的工人。
	- WTC Dust as a source of alkaline dust exposure
	- Post-collapse human exposures to WTC Dust in Lower Manhattan, in terms of potential for inhalation exposures
		- workers at Ground Zero, cleanup workers, and local residents/evacuees. Moreover, these exposures varied with time post 9/11. These time-related factors included 1) During Day 1, most people living or working in Lower Manhattan were undergoing mandatory evacuation on foot to more northerly parts of Manhattan or to Brooklyn via the walkways on the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges over the East River. Most of the evacuees were covered with dust and had significant inhalation exposures during the exodus. Even greater inhalation exposures befell firefighters, police personnel, and volunteers who rushed to Ground Zero to engage in vigorous attempts to rescue survivors as most did so without access to, and proper use of, personal protective equipment (PPE), including respirators; 2) During Days 2 and 3, inhalation exposures of evacuees were mostly much lower than on Day 1, while an increasing number of rescue and recovery workers continued to be highly exposed as their activities resulted in resuspension of the settled dusts. Only a small fraction of the outdoor workers had respirators, and only some used them. Those that did have and use PPE often had to remove them within a few hours because the filters become clogged with dust, making the effort to breathe through them too great; 3) During succeeding days, weeks, and months, inhalation exposures of outdoor workers were much lower due to rains that removed and/or neutralized the alkalinity of the residual settled dust. Some workers and residents were engaged in indoor dust removal during the first few weeks, and their number increased over the succeeding weeks and months. Many indoor workers engaged in cleaning heavily contaminated buildings were asbestos remediation workers trained in the use negative pressure respirators and had been fit tested on their proper use. However, the indoor dusts remained highly alkaline, and the respirator filters often became clogged within the first few hours of their standard workdays. As a result, their inhalation exposures later in the workday to WTC Dust later in the workday could become high. Exposures of the evacuees remained low, so long as they stayed away from areas surrounding Ground Zero. Most residents and workers from residential and commercial buildings were not permitted into their Lower Manhattan buildings until the sites were certified as been cleaned. For most residents, the reoccupation of their apartments took place over many weeks, while the many office workers were back at work within a few weeks (Reibman et al. 2009). However, the adequacy of the initial cleanings was often disputed, leading to many second-stage cleanings and concerns about exposures occurring between the cleanings; and 4) Actions taken/not taken to analyze and/or minimize indoor exposures to WTC Dusts: The building owners and their managers, lacking experience with such an unprecedented disaster, generally followed government agency mandates and guidelines for minimizing inhalation exposures to WTC Dust (GAO Report 2004). Unfortunately, as these agencies also lacked experience with such a disaster, the information they provided has, in retrospect, proved to be inadequate with respect to health protection.
		- 归零地的工作人员、清理人员和当地居民/撤离人员。此外，这些曝光量在9/11事件后随时间变化。这些与时间相关的因素包括：1）在第一天，大多数在曼哈顿下城生活或工作的人都被强制步行疏散到曼哈顿更北部，或通过东河上的布鲁克林和曼哈顿大桥上的人行道疏散到布鲁克林。大多数撤离人员身上都沾满了灰尘，在撤离期间有大量的吸入暴露。消防员、警察和志愿者面临着更大的吸入性暴露，他们赶往归零地，积极营救幸存者，因为大多数人在没有获得和正确使用包括呼吸器在内的个人防护装备的情况下这样做；2） 在第2天和第3天，撤离人员的吸入暴露量大多比第1天低得多，而越来越多的救援和恢复人员继续高度暴露，因为他们的活动导致沉降的灰尘重新悬浮。只有一小部分户外工作者有呼吸器，只有一些人使用。那些拥有并使用个人防护装备的人往往不得不在几个小时内将其取下，因为过滤器被灰尘堵塞，使通过它们呼吸的努力太大；3） 在接下来的几天、几周和几个月里，由于雨水去除和/或中和了残留沉降灰尘的碱度，户外工作者的吸入暴露量要低得多。在最初的几周里，一些工人和居民从事室内除尘工作，在接下来的几周和几个月里，他们的人数有所增加。许多从事清洁严重污染建筑的室内工人都是受过负压呼吸器使用培训的石棉修复工人，并接受了正确使用的健康测试。然而，室内灰尘仍然是高碱性的，呼吸器的过滤器经常在标准工作日的最初几个小时内堵塞。因此，他们在工作日晚些时候吸入WTC粉尘可能会变得很高。撤离人员的暴露程度仍然很低，只要他们远离世贸遗址周围的地区。大多数居民和住宅和商业建筑的工人在被证明清洁之前，都不允许进入曼哈顿下城的建筑。对于大多数居民来说，他们的公寓在数周内重新被占用，而许多上班族在几周内就回到了工作岗位（Reibman等人，2009）。然而，最初清洁的充分性经常存在争议，导致许多第二阶段清洁，并担心清洁之间会出现暴露；和4）为分析和/或最大限度地减少WTC粉尘的室内暴露而采取/未采取的行动：建筑物所有者及其管理人员缺乏应对这种前所未有的灾难的经验，通常遵循政府机构的授权和指南，以最大限度地减少吸入WTC粉尘（美国政府问责局2004年报告）。不幸的是，由于这些机构也缺乏应对此类灾难的经验，回想起来，它们提供的信息在健康保护方面被证明是不够的。
	- Health Effect
		- Many of the government agencies listed in Table 2, from the testimony of Janet Heinrich of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to a House Subcommittee (GAO Report 2004), were sufficiently concerned about potential health effects from exposures to WTC Dusts that they promptly mobilized teams of scientific investigators to be sent into Lower Manhattan in the first few days after 9/11/01 to collect and analyze samples of settled and airborne dusts. In addition, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) encouraged and supported individual and collaborative on-site and laboratorybased investigations by their University-based Environmental Health Science Research Centers in the northeastern US (Table 3). These NIEHS-sponsored WTC-related studies led to numerous publications, as listed in Table 4. Table 4 also lists WTC-related health effects research studies that were supported by other sponsors. The increased incidences of health effects that have been reported in the respiratory and gastroesophageal tracts, reviewed in the next section, are the main focus of this critical review. There have also been reports of low birth weight and birth defects in children exposed in utero (Berkowitz et al. 2003, Lederman et al. 2004), and of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) (Fairbrother et al. 2003, Boscarino et al. 2003, Galea et al. 2003, Brackbill et al. 2009, Luft et al. 2012, Friedman et al. 2013), and there is concern about excess cancer incidence that may become evident in future years. Adverse health effects, such as birth defects, cancer, and cardiovascular responses are beyond the scope of this review.
		- 表2中列出的许多政府机构，从美国政府问责局（GAO）的Janet Heinrich向众议院小组委员会的证词（GAO报告2004），他们非常担心接触WTC粉尘对健康的潜在影响，因此在2001年9月11日后的头几天，他们迅速动员了科学调查小组被派往曼哈顿下城，收集和分析沉降和空气传播的粉尘样本。此外，美国国家环境健康科学研究所（NIEHS）鼓励并支持其位于美国东北部的大学环境卫生科学研究中心进行的个人和合作现场和实验室调查（表3）。这些NIEHS赞助的WTC相关研究导致了许多出版物，如表4所示。表4还列出了其他赞助商支持的WTC相关健康影响研究。下一节将对*呼吸和胃食管*中报告的健康影响发生率的增加进行综述，这是本次关键综述的主要焦点。也有关于子宫内暴露的儿童出生体重低和出生缺陷的报告（Berkowitz等人2003，Lederman等人2004），以及创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的报告（Fairbrother等人2003，Boscarino等人2003，Galea等人2003，Brackbill等人2009，Luft等人2012，Friedman等人2013），人们对癌症发病率过高的担忧可能在未来几年变得明显。出生缺陷、癌症和心血管反应等不良健康影响超出了本综述的范围。
- Measure WTC PM
	- In the days after the September 11 attack, many Federal agencies were called on to bring their technical and scientific expertise to bear on addressing the emergency in NYC. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), other federal agencies, and NYC and New York State (NYS) public health and environmental authorities initiated numerous air monitoring activities to understand the nature and extent of ongoing toxicant exposures. These efforts generated an immense amount of data. Many EPA offices and programs became involved, providing scientific, engineering, public health, and management experience to help cope with the after-effects. EPA Region 2, which includes the NYC metropolitan area in New York and New Jersey, was designated the EPA lead office for these activities, and it requested the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) to conduct a human health evaluation of exposure to air pollutants resulting from the WTC disaster. The ORD evaluation, summarized in EPA (2002), relied primarily on the analyses of ambient air samples of PM2.5 collected by fixed-site monitors that were located at the perimeter of the WTC Ground Zero and at various other sites in Lower Manhattan and the surrounding areas. It assessed the PM2.5 inhalation exposure and potential human health risk incurred by the general population residing and working in the vicinity of the WTC. Numerous other efforts were conducted that addressed other aspects of exposure and potential risk associated with the collapse of the WTC towers, including 1) Ground Zero worker exposures on the debris pile and its disposal: EPA (2002) also reviewed data collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that addressed the respirable WTC Dust exposures faced by fireman and other rescue workers, but it did not explicitly evaluate these exposures; 2) Indoor exposures: In addition, EPA (2002) reviewed data collected on indoor air and dust, particularly a study by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and provided an overview of the efforts by EPA Region 2 to clean apartments and evaluate the characteristics of indoor air and dust; and 3) Epidemiology studies: Chapter 7 of EPA (2002) provided an overview of studies that evaluated health impacts experienced by workers and others known to be in the vicinity of the WTC in the days and weeks following September 11, 2001. The composition of the settled dust in the different particle size ranges is shown in Table 5. The ambient air PM2.5 monitoring activities described in EPA (2002) were undertaken by federal, state, and local agencies that made their analytical results available to EPA for analysis. Most of the air quality monitors were placed, following the disaster, with the intent of characterizing outdoor levels of WTC-generated air pollutants at locations surrounding the WTC site at different distances. Some monitoring data for airborne PM had been collected by NYS prior to the 9/11/2001 disaster.
	- 在9·11袭击事件发生后的几天里，许多联邦机构被要求将其技术和科学专业知识用于应对纽约市的紧急情况。美国环境保护局（EPA）、其他联邦机构以及纽约市和纽约州公共卫生和环境当局发起了大量空气监测活动，以了解持续接触有毒物质的性质和程度。这些努力产生了大量的数据。许多环保局办公室和项目都参与其中，提供科学、工程、公共卫生和管理经验，以帮助应对后遗症。美国环保局第二地区，包括纽约和新泽西的纽约大都会区，被指定为美国环保局这些活动的牵头办公室，并要求美国环保局研发办公室（ORD）对WTC灾难造成的空气污染物暴露进行人类健康评估。美国环保局（2002）中总结的ORD评估主要依赖于位于世贸中心归零地周边以及曼哈顿下城及周边地区其他各个地点的固定地点监测器收集的PM2.5环境空气样本的分析。它评估了在世贸中心附近居住和工作的普通人群的PM2.5吸入暴露和潜在的人类健康风险。进行了许多其他努力，以解决与WTC塔倒塌相关的暴露和潜在风险的其他方面，包括1）归零地工作人员在碎片堆上的暴露及其处置：美国环保局（2002）还审查了职业安全与健康管理局（OSHA）和美国国家职业安全与卫生研究所（NIOSH）收集的数据，这些数据涉及消防员和其他救援人员面临的可呼吸WTC粉尘暴露，但没有明确评估这些暴露；2） 室内暴露：此外，环境保护局（2002年）审查了收集的室内空气和灰尘的数据，特别是纽约市卫生和精神卫生部（NYCDOHMH）和有毒物质和疾病登记局（ATSDR）的一项研究，并概述了环境保护局第二区为清洁公寓和评估室内空气和粉尘的特性所做的努力；和3）流行病学研究：EPA（2002）第7章概述了评估工人和已知在WTC附近的其他人在2001年9月11日之后的几天和几周内所经历的健康影响的研究。在不同颗粒尺寸范围内的沉降灰尘的组成如表5所示。美国环保局（2002）中描述的环境空气PM2.5监测活动由联邦、州和地方机构进行，这些机构将其分析结果提供给美国环保局进行分析。大多数空气质量监测器都是在灾难发生后安装的，目的是表征WTC现场周围不同距离的室外WTC产生的空气污染物水平。2001年9月11日灾难发生前，纽约州气象局已经收集了一些空气中PM的监测数据。
	- EPA (2002) focused on: the overall mass concentration of PM2.5, and the concentrations of lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni) compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin-like compounds, asbestos, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the PM2.5, on the basis that Pb and asbestos were components of the WTC building materials; PCBs were used as dielectric fluid in transformers and capacitors; and that dioxin and VOCs were produced as a result of fuel combustion/volatilization. The assessment was limited mainly to the inhalation of airborne contaminants, although dust ingestion and dermal contact also led to exposures at and near Ground Zero. As notable as the toxicants whose airborne concentrations were monitored were those that were not monitored, especially the three WTC Dust components that contributed 80-90% of the mass of the settled WTC Dust, that is, crushed concrete, gypsum, and SVF. The most intense period of exposure was during the collapse and the next 12 h, when Lower Manhattan was enveloped by dusts, smoke, and pollutant gases (Lioy et al. 2006). Dust and smoke were deposited on the ground and surfaces both outside and inside offices, businesses, and residential buildings. Samples were collected in October 2001 by Geyh et al. (2005), for truckers working at Ground Zero after the first 3 days; some peak total particle levels were > 15,000 μg/m3. In 39 firefighters with significant WTC exposure, Fireman et al. (2004) found significant amounts of both fine and supercoarse particles in induced sputum (mid- and lower-airway sampling), with a size distribution and composition similar to WTC Dust. Significant elevations of the concentrations of these contaminants that were monitored by EPA were found within and near Ground Zero for a short period of time after September 11, with elevation denoting concentrations higher by a factor of 10 or more, and often by factors of 100 or 1000, compared with other measurements of the contaminant taken after September 14 when the WTC monitoring program was initiated, and many of the elevated measurements occurred in “restricted zones,” that is, zones where access was limited to emergency management and rescue personnel and to other credentialed people. In general, the monitoring data, even within Ground Zero, indicated that ambient air PM2.5 levels for all of these substances decreased to background ambient concentrations characteristic of preSeptember 11 levels in the NYC metropolitan area by February of 2002. EPA (2002) concluded that 1) persons exposed to the extremely high levels of ambient PM2.5 and its components during the WTC Towers’ collapse, and for several hours afterward, were at risk for immediate acute (and possibly chronic) respiratory and other types (e.g., cardiovascular) of symptoms; 2) because the first measurements were on September 14 and those of other contaminants were not measured until September 23, and as concentrations within and near Ground Zero were highest in the few days after 9/11, exposures and potential health impacts could not be evaluated with certainty; and 3) except for exposures on September 9/11 and possibly during the next few days, persons in the surrounding community were unlikely to suffer short- or long-term adverse health effects caused by exposure to elevations in ambient air concentrations of the evaluated contaminants. Elevated concentrations were measured mostly within and very near Ground Zero, and lasted for 1–3 months after 9/11. EPA (2002) also provided summaries of its findings for each contaminant or class of contaminants it had selected as a likely, or at least a possible, risk factor as follows:
	- EPA（2002）重点关注：PM2.5的总体质量浓度，以及PM2.5中铅（Pb）、铬（Cr）和镍（Ni）化合物、多氯联苯（PCBs）、二恶英类化合物、石棉和挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的浓度，基于铅和石棉是WTC建筑材料的成分；多氯联苯被用作变压器和电容器中的电介质；并且由于燃料燃烧/挥发而产生二恶英和挥发性有机物。评估主要限于吸入空气中的污染物，尽管灰尘摄入和皮肤接触也会导致在归零地及其附近暴露。与空气中浓度被监测的毒物一样值得注意的是那些没有被监测的有毒物质，特别是占沉降WTC粉尘质量80-90%的三种WTC粉尘成分，即碎混凝土、石膏和SVF。最强烈的暴露期是在坍塌期间和接下来的12小时，当时曼哈顿下城被灰尘、烟雾和污染气体包围（Lioy等人，2006）。灰尘和烟雾沉积在办公室、企业和住宅楼内外的地面和表面上。Geyh等人（2005年）于2001年10月为在归零地工作的卡车司机采集了前3天的样本；一些峰值总颗粒水平>15000μg/m3。Fireman等人（2004）在39名严重接触WTC的消防员中，在诱导痰中发现了大量的细颗粒和超硬颗粒（中下呼吸道采样），其大小分布和成分与WTC粉尘相似。美国环保局监测到的这些污染物的浓度在9月11日后的短时间内在归零地及其附近显著升高，升高表示浓度升高了10倍或更多，通常是100或1000倍，与9月14日WTC监测计划启动后对污染物进行的其他测量相比，许多升高的测量值发生在“限制区”，即应急管理和救援人员以及其他有资质的人员只能进入的区域。总的来说，即使在归零地，监测数据也表明，到2002年2月，纽约大都会区所有这些物质的环境空气PM2.5水平都降至9月11日前的背景环境浓度。EPA（2002）得出的结论是：1）在世贸大厦倒塌期间以及之后的几个小时内，暴露在极高水平的环境PM2.5及其成分中的人有立即出现急性（可能是慢性）呼吸道和其他类型（如心血管）症状的风险；2） 由于第一次测量是在9月14日，而其他污染物的测量直到9月23日才进行，而且由于在9/11之后的几天里，归零地内和附近的浓度最高，因此无法确定地评估暴露和潜在的健康影响；和3）除了9月9日至11日以及可能在接下来的几天内的暴露外，周围社区的人不太可能因暴露于环境空气中评估污染物浓度的升高而遭受短期或长期的不良健康影响。升高的浓度主要在归零地内和非常接近归零地的地方测量，并在9/11后持续了1-3个月。环保局（2002年）还提供了其选择的每种污染物或污染物类别的调查结果摘要，作为可能的或至少可能的风险因素，如下所示：
	- Particulate matter (PM)—People caught in the initial dust/smoke cloud that encompassed Lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC buildings on September 11 were briefly exposed (4–8 h) to levels of airborne PM2.5.in the mg/m3 range, that is, thousands of μg/m3. During the first several days after the disaster, PM2.5 levels at the WTC perimeter exceeded the EPA daily National Ambient Air Quality Standard or NAAQS for PM2.5 (65 μg/m3, 24-hr); and PM2.5 concentrations at some other nearby Lower Manhattan sites exceeded EPA’s 40 μg/m3 24-h Air Quality Index (AQI) level of concern for susceptible subgroups in the general population. The elevated PM concentrations recorded very near WTC Ground Zero during late September and early October may have increased the risks of chronic health effects for the most highly exposed individuals (e.g., persons spending extended periods of time within the WTC work zone without wearing protective respirators). By mid to late October, PM2.5 values across Lower Manhattan had largely returned to levels typical of NYC and other US urban areas, with only a few WTC or nearby sites occasionally approaching or exceeding the AQI level of concern. Lead (Pb)—Persons caught in the initial WTC-related dust cloud experienced brief exposures to high Pb levels based on analyses of deposited dust samples. In late September 2001, air Pb concentrations at the WTC perimeter sites reached > 1.5 μg/m3on some days, that is, significantly greater than urban background levels in U.S. cities. After mid-October, airborne Pb at all sites in Lower Manhattan outside Ground Zero dropped to levels comparable with background concentrations typical of NYC and other Northeastern US urban areas. Chromium (Cr)—Samples evaluated for total Cr at Ground Zero and at the surrounding sites never exceeded the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 1 mg/m3or the ATSDR Intermediate Minimum Risk Level or MRL for Cr(VI) particles of 1.0 μg/m3. Nickel (Ni)—Nickel samples evaluated at Ground Zero and at the surrounding sites never exceeded the OSHA PEL of 1 mg/m3. The concentrations of various elements (e.g., calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), and other metals) in WTC PM2.5 particles also were above typical background levels on an episodic basis at sites on or near the WTC perimeter on some days extending into late October and November 2001. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)—Of several hundred PCB air measurements available, only one was > 100 ng/m3 (at 153 ng/m3) and only three were > 50 ng/m3. This compared with typical urban background PCB concentrations in the range of 1–8 ng PCB/m3. After a month, nearly all readings were in the range of typical urban PCB concentrations or were not detected. There were no exceedances of any short-term occupational health benchmark.
	- 颗粒物（PM）——9月11日世贸中心大楼倒塌后，人们被笼罩在曼哈顿下城的最初尘埃云/烟云中，短暂暴露在空气中PM2.5的水平下（4-8小时），在mg/m3范围内，即数千微克/立方米。在灾难发生后的头几天，WTC周边的PM2.5水平超过了美国环保局每日PM2.5国家环境空气质量标准（65微克/立方米，24小时）；曼哈顿下城附近其他一些地点的PM2.5浓度超过了美国环保局对普通人群中易感亚组关注的40微克/立方米24小时空气质量指数（AQI）水平。*9月底和10月初，在世贸中心归零地附近记录到的PM浓度升高*，可能增加了暴露程度最高的个人（例如，在世贸工作区内长时间不戴防护口罩的人）的慢性健康影响风险。到10月中下旬，曼哈顿下城的PM2.5值已基本恢复到纽约市和美国其他城市地区的典型水平，只有少数WTC或附近的站点偶尔接近或超过令人担忧的空气质量指数水平。铅（Pb）——根据对沉积灰尘样本的分析，最初被WTC相关尘埃云捕获的人经历了短暂的高铅暴露。2001年9月下旬，WTC周边地区的空气铅浓度在某些日子达到>1.5微克/立方米，也就是说，明显高于美国城市的城市背景水平。10月中旬之后，曼哈顿下城归零地以外所有地点的空气中铅浓度降至与纽约市和美国东北部其他城市地区的典型背景浓度相当的水平。铬（Cr）——对归零地和周围地点的总Cr进行评估的样本从未超过1 mg/m3的OSHA允许暴露限值（PEL）或1.0μg/m3的ATSDR中间最低风险水平（MRL）。镍（Ni）——在归零地和周围地点评估的镍样品从未超过1 mg/m3的OSHA PEL。WTC PM2.5颗粒中各种元素（例如钙（Ca）、硫（S）、硅（Si）和其他金属）的浓度在WTC周边或附近的一些地点也偶尔高于典型的背景水平，一直持续到2001年10月下旬和11月。多氯联苯——在数百个可用的多氯联苯空气测量值中，只有一个大于100纳克/立方米（153纳克/立方米），只有三个大于50纳克/立方米。这与1–8 ng PCB/m3范围内的典型城市背景多氯联苯浓度进行了比较。一个月后，几乎所有读数都在典型的城市多氯联苯浓度范围内，或者没有检测到。没有超过任何短期职业健康基准。
	- Dioxins—The dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels in air near Ground Zero were up to three orders of magnitude higher than is typical for US urban areas (0.1–0.2 pg TEQ/m3). Levels found in and near Ground Zero, starting September 23 (date of first sample taken) and continuing through late November ranged from 10 to > 150 pg TEQ/m3. Levels measured several blocks from Ground Zero were still elevated above typical urban background, but considerably lower than sites in or near Ground Zero. Everywhere these elevations dropped rapidly; by December 2001, levels had decreased to background. Asbestos fibers—The large majority of outside air measurements of asbestos fiber count concentrations were within the range of typical background levels. The few exceedances that occurred near September 11 were in time and close in proximity to Ground Zero. A large systematic study in November and December of 2001 suggested that indoor levels of asbestos in WTC Dusts were slightly higher near Ground Zero as compared with indoor levels in buildings further away. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—Ground Zero samples of VOCs were not representative of general air quality at the site. Most samples were collected from plumes of fires and smoldering rubble in order to alert the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) and the contractors/union health/safety officers working on-site about conditions that might pose immediate health concerns. Thus, analyses of Ground Zero worker exposures to VOCs were not conducted. Eleven VOCs were evaluated at sites surrounding Ground Zero, and there were no exceedances of screening benchmarks for 1,4-dioxane, ethanol, styrene, tetrahydrofuran, and xylenes. Exceedances of screening benchmarks were seen for acetone, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, chloromethane, ethylbenzene, and toluene, but except for benzene, exceedances for these chemicals occurred only in restricted zones. Also, the exceedances were all grab samples, and 24-h samples of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylbenzene, and toluene which were about three orders of magnitude (1000 times) lower. The exceedances for benzene were more frequent; some were further from Ground Zero than the other VOCs, suggesting benzene above typical background (by about a factor of 10) may have been sustained for a month or more post-September 11. The issue of the alkalinity of WTC Dust, and its potential as a possible health concern for exposed individuals, was raised by observations by the USGS and academic researchers of high pH (>~ 10.0) values for aqueous solutions of the settled WTC Dusts that had not been leached by rainfall. After late September, indoor exposures to such dust probably warranted more concern than outdoor exposures for possible acute irritating effects or more chronic health effects. This was not only because of the basic nature of some constituent particles but also because of other unusual features of the materials, such as the presence of slender microscopic glass fibers with sharp ends, and with toxic materials attached to them.
	- 二恶英——归零地附近空气中的二恶英毒性当量（TEQ）水平比美国城市地区的典型水平（0.1–0.2 pg TEQ/m3）高出三个数量级。从9月23日（第一次采样之日）开始，一直持续到11月下旬，在归零地及其附近发现的浓度范围为10至>150 pg TEQ/m3。距离归零地几个街区测得的水位仍高于典型的城市背景，但远低于归零地或附近的地点。这些海拔到处都在迅速下降；截至2001年12月，这一水平已降至背景水平。石棉纤维——大多数室外空气中石棉纤维计数浓度的测量值都在典型的背景水平范围内。9月11日附近发生的为数不多的超标事件及时且接近归零地。2001年11月和12月的一项大型系统研究表明，与更远建筑的室内水平相比，世贸中心灰尘中的室内石棉水平在归零地附近略高。挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）——VOCs的归零地样本不能代表现场的一般空气质量。大多数样本是从浓烟和闷烧的瓦砾中收集的，目的是提醒纽约消防局（FDNY）和在现场工作的承包商/工会健康/安全官员注意可能造成直接健康问题的情况。因此，没有对归零地工人接触挥发性有机物的情况进行分析。在归零地周围的地点评估了11种挥发性有机物，1，4-二恶烷、乙醇、苯乙烯、四氢呋喃和二甲苯的筛选基准没有超标。丙酮、苯、1,3-丁二烯、氯甲烷、乙苯和甲苯都超过了筛选基准，但除苯外，这些化学品的超标情况仅发生在限制区。此外，超标的都是抓握样品，苯、1,3-丁二烯、乙苯和甲苯的24小时样品低了约三个数量级（1000倍）。苯超标现象更为频繁；一些挥发性有机物比其他挥发性有机物离归零地更远，这表明苯高于典型背景（约10倍）可能在9月11日后持续了一个月或更长时间。美国地质调查局和学术研究人员对未经降雨浸出的沉淀WTC粉尘水溶液的高pH值（>~10.0）进行了观察，提出了WTC粉尘的碱度及其可能对接触者的健康造成的潜在问题。9月下旬之后，室内暴露于此类灰尘可能比室外暴露更令人担忧，因为室内暴露可能会产生急性刺激性影响或更慢性的健康影响。这不仅是因为一些组成颗粒的基本性质，还因为材料的其他不寻常特征，例如存在具有尖锐末端的细长微观玻璃纤维，并且其上附着有有毒材料。
- Occupational and Indoor Exposure
	- Extensive data sets regarding occupational exposures at Ground Zero were made available to EPA by OSHA and NIOSH on occupational exposures at Ground Zero after 9/11/01. Many of these samples were collected using personal air PM2.5 monitors. According to EPA (2002), the vast majority of samples in both data sets were below occupational standards and guidelines, including OSHA PELs and NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits or RELs. The ATSDR completed a study of residential apartments (NYCDOHMH/ATSDR 2002). As summarized in EPA (2002), testing occurred between November 4 and December 11, and included 57 apartments in Lower Manhattan as well as five comparison apartments. For all the tested sites, airborne fibers were not detected above background levels. However, bulk dust samples showed there was asbestos in 16% of the apartments in Lower Manhattan, and none in the more distant comparison sites. Further, SVFs (i.e., slag wool or fibrous glass) were found in both indoor and outdoor samples in Lower Manhattan. Another study sampling indoor air and dust on September 18, in two locations very near Ground Zero, found asbestos in both air and dust, as well as low background concentrations of dioxin, PCBs, and metals. There were, and remain, key problems with the interpretation of the WTC-related air quality monitoring. These included, in the first few years, issues with the protocols selected for characterizing exposures related to indoor cleanup operations, and documentation of the exposure and health risks to other people in Lower Manhattan buildings. A main problem, associated with these assessments, was a failure to first adequately consider 1) the unique particle size distribution and chemical composition of the WTC Dust; 2) the likelihood of excessive inhalation exposures; and 3) the optimal means for preventing and/or controlling excessive exposures. Most importantly, there was “tunnel vision” by all parties that focused excessively on known toxicants that were present as small mass fractions. These known toxicants, collectively, made up only a small percentage of the WTC Dust and of the PM2.5 in the air samples that were analyzed; with nearly all of the WTC Dust consisting of > 2.5 μm particles, with most of the mass being in particles > 10 μm in diameter. Further, little consideration was given to the potential of toxic effects from inhaling PM containing three major mass components in the particles larger than 2.5 μm, for example, crushed concrete, gypsum, and SVFs, each of which is a known irritant. These three major mass components made up 80–90% of the settled WTC Dust and were assumed, incorrectly, to be nuisance dusts when resuspended into the air that people in Lower Manhattan were breathing. These problems were compounded by the intense initial focus in the public media on asbestos fibers as the index toxicant for WTC Dust, and in technical guidance of exposure monitoring and control. There was a secondary focus on other trace components that were considered to pose health risks, that is, metals, molds, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, and dioxins. While there was some chrysotile asbestos insulation within the first 20 floors of the WTC North Tower, there was none in the other 80 floors, or in the South Tower, and no amphibole asbestos fibers in either building. Prolonged exposures to chrysotile fibers longer than 20 μm can cause lung cancer (Lippmann 2014a); the current occupational exposure limit of 0.01 fibers/ml of air as a long-term average is based on counts of asbestos fibers longer than 5 μm. Very few of the many airborne asbestos fiber measurements in the EPA WTC database exceeded this conservative fiber count limit, even in the first few days when the fiber concentrations were highest. The measured concentrations of the trace metals, mold, PAHs, and PCBs—as summarized by Lorber et al. (2007), and described in greater detail in EPA (2002)—were also almost all lower than current occupational exposure limits.
	- 2001年9月11日之后，OSHA和NIOSH向EPA提供了大量关于归零地职业暴露的数据集。其中许多样本是使用个人空气PM2.5监测仪采集的。根据美国环保局（2002）的说法，这两个数据集中的绝大多数样本都低于职业标准和指南，包括OSHA PEL和NIOSH推荐的暴露限值或REL。ATSDR完成了对住宅公寓的研究（NYCDOHM/ATSDR，2002年）。正如EPA（2002）所总结的，测试发生在11月4日至12月11日之间，包括曼哈顿下城的57套公寓以及5套对比公寓。在所有测试地点，未检测到高于本底水平的空气传播纤维。然而，大量灰尘样本显示，曼哈顿下城16%的公寓中有石棉，而在更远的比较地点则没有。此外，在曼哈顿下城的室内和室外样本中都发现了SVF（即矿渣棉或纤维玻璃）。9月18日，在离归零地很近的两个地方，另一项对室内空气和灰尘进行采样的研究发现，空气和灰尘中都有石棉，二恶英、多氯联苯和金属的背景浓度也很低。WTC相关空气质量监测的解释过去存在，现在仍然存在关键问题。在最初的几年里，这些问题包括用于表征与室内清理作业相关的暴露的协议问题，以及曼哈顿下城建筑中其他人的暴露和健康风险的文件。与这些评估相关的一个主要问题是，未能首先充分考虑1）WTC粉尘的独特粒度分布和化学成分；2） 过度吸入暴露的可能性；以及3）用于防止和/或控制过度曝光的最佳手段。最重要的是，各方都存在“隧道视野”，过度关注以小质量分数存在的已知毒物。这些已知的有毒物质加在一起，只占所分析空气样本中WTC粉尘和PM2.5的一小部分；几乎所有的WTC粉尘都由>2.5μm的颗粒组成，大部分质量都在直径>10μm的粒子中。此外，很少考虑吸入颗粒中含有三种主要质量成分的PM的毒性影响，这些成分在大于2.5μm的颗粒中，例如压碎的混凝土、石膏和SVF，每种都是已知的刺激物。这三种主要质量成分占沉降的WTC粉尘的80-90%，当重新悬浮到曼哈顿下城人们呼吸的空气中时，被错误地认为是有害粉尘。公共媒体最初高度关注石棉纤维作为WTC粉尘的指标毒物，以及接触监测和控制的技术指导，加剧了这些问题。其次关注被认为对健康构成风险的其他微量成分，即金属、霉菌、多环芳烃、多氯联苯和二恶英。虽然世贸中心北塔的前20层有一些温石棉隔热材料，但其他80层或南塔没有，两栋楼都没有角闪石石棉纤维。长时间接触温石棉纤维超过20μm可导致肺癌癌症（Lippmann 2014a）；目前的职业接触限值为0.01纤维/毫升空气，作为长期平均值，是基于超过5微米的石棉纤维计数。美国环保局WTC数据库中的许多空气中石棉纤维测量值很少超过这一保守的纤维计数限制，即使在纤维浓度最高的最初几天也是如此。Lorber等人（2007年）总结了微量金属、霉菌、多环芳烃和多氯联苯的测量浓度，并在EPA（2002年）中进行了更详细的描述，这些浓度几乎都低于当前的职业接触限值。
	- Since we know that many people developed respiratory and gastroesophageal illnesses after exposure to WTC Dusts, and we also now know that established occupational and ambient air exposure limits had seldom, and only briefly, been exceeded in the PM2.5 samples, it is clear, at least to the authors of this review, that exposure components that had not been measured (such as the coarse alkaline particles and SVFs) were the ones most likely responsible for the observed increased incidence of adverse health effects in people exposed to WTC Dusts. We are not the first to question the lack of attention to the coarse particles. Lioy et al. (2006) reported that “the particles in greatest abundance (mass) in the (WTC) dust were the unregulated supercoarse (> 10 μm diameter) particles.” They also noted that “Given the health effects, one issue that should have been obvious, after 9/11, was the need for a rapid characterization of the total (alkaline) dust.” It is indeed unfortunate that their on target and reasonable concerns were ignored. The next section reviews our broader review of the exposure factors not initially considered that, if they had been addressed in a mid-course reconsideration of ongoing monitoring and guidance, could have led to a minimization of at least some of the adverse health effects that did occur.
	- 由于我们知道许多人在接触WTC粉尘后患上了呼吸系统和胃食管疾病，而且我们现在也知道PM2.5样本中很少而且只是短暂地超过既定的职业和环境空气暴露限值，因此很明显，至少对本综述的作者来说，未经测量的暴露成分（如粗碱性颗粒和SVF）最有可能导致接触WTC粉尘的人不良健康影响发生率增加。我们不是第一个质疑对粗颗粒缺乏关注的人。Lioy等人（2006年）报告称，“（WTC）灰尘中丰度（质量）最大的颗粒是不受管制的超高温（直径>10μm）颗粒。”他们还指出，“考虑到对健康的影响，在9/11之后，一个本应显而易见的问题是需要对总（碱性）灰尘进行快速表征。”。“令人遗憾的是，他们对目标的合理关注被忽视了。下一节回顾了我们对暴露因素的更广泛审查，这些因素最初没有考虑到，如果在对正在进行的监测和指导进行中期重新考虑时加以解决，可能会导致至少一些确实发生的不良健康影响最小化。
	- Figure 1A illustrates that thick deposits of WTC Dust covered outdoor surfaces in Lower Manhattan during the first day after the attack on September 11, 2001. WTC Dust covered indoor surfaces for much longer periods of time (Figure 1B). To characterize the chemical composition, particle size distribution, and potential for resuspension of the settled dust particles into human breathing zones, Chen et al. at NYU size-fractionated seven WTC settled dust samples that were collected by NYU personnel in Lower Manhattan on September 12 and 13, 2001, as reported in Yiin et al. (2006). Aliquots of these samples were sieved through a 53-μm mesh screen mounted on a shaker. The PM53 fraction passing through the screen was then aerosolized into a vertical elutriation chamber and passed through a size-selective air sampler inlet with a 10-μm aerodynamic diameter cut to remove particles in the 10–53 μm range, thereby isolating the PM10 fraction. The PM10 fraction was then passed through a cyclone cut at 2.5 μm to remove the coarse fraction (PM10–2.5). The PM2.5 fraction was collected on Teflon filters. Each individual size-fractionated sample was then subjected to physical and chemical analyses. Most of their key findings, summarized in Table 1, have previously been described (Lioy et al. 2002, McGee et al. 2003, Yiin et al. 2006). Similar work on elutriation and chemical and physical analyses was performed on settled indoor WTC Dust samples that were collected in June of 2002 for a private client (Lee personal communication, Dec. 2014). Key elements of the Lee findings were summarized earlier in this review. There were substantial commonalities in the findings of the two teams of independent investigators.
	- 图1A显示，在2001年9月11日袭击事件发生后的第一天，厚厚的WTC灰尘覆盖了曼哈顿下城的室外表面。WTC灰尘覆盖室内表面的时间要长得多（图1B）。为了表征沉降灰尘颗粒的化学成分、粒度分布和再悬浮到人类呼吸区的可能性，Chen等人在纽约大学对纽约大学工作人员于2001年9月12日和13日在曼哈顿下城收集的七个WTC沉降灰尘样本进行了分级，如Yiin等人（2006）所述。这些样品的等分试样通过安装在振动筛上的53μm筛网进行筛分。然后，通过筛网的PM53馏分被雾化到垂直淘析室中，并通过具有10μm空气动力学直径的尺寸选择性空气采样器入口，以去除10–53μm范围内的颗粒，从而隔离PM10馏分。然后，将PM10颗粒通过2.5μm的旋风分离器去除粗颗粒（PM10–2.5）。将PM2.5颗粒收集在聚四氟乙烯过滤器上。然后对每个单独尺寸的分馏样品进行物理和化学分析。表1中总结了他们的大多数关键发现，这些发现以前都有描述（Lioy等人，2002年，McGee等人，2003年，Yiin等人，2006年）。对2002年6月为一位私人客户收集的WTC室内沉降粉尘样本进行了类似的淘析、化学和物理分析工作（Lee个人通讯，2014年12月）。李研究结果的关键要素在本综述的早些时候进行了总结。两个独立调查小组的调查结果有很大的共同点。
	- The WTC Dust, as summarized in the “Introduction” section, differed greatly from conventional airborne dusts encountered in occupational and community settings in terms of particle size distribution and chemical composition. Therefore, it is important to discuss the special circumstances of WTC Dusts in terms of the dosimetry of the inhaled dusts.如“引言”部分所述，WTC粉尘在颗粒大小分布和化学成分方面与职业和社区环境中遇到的传统空气传播粉尘有很大不同。因此，从吸入粉尘的剂量测定角度讨论WTC粉尘的特殊情况是很重要的。
- PM deposition and clean from lung
	- The penetration of inhaled particles into the thorax is limited by their deposition in the URT during inspiration, which varies with particle size distribution; flow rate and tidal volume; the fraction passing through the oral pathway; and in vivo airway dimensions. All of these factors are quite variable from person-to-person, depending on age, transient illness, cigaret smoke exposure, and other short-term toxicant exposures that cause transient airway constriction, as well as elements of occupational histories associated with loss of lung function or cumulative injury. Figure 6 shows experimental data on particle penetration through the oral pathway of healthy human adults as a function of particle aerodynamic diameter. It also shows the sampler acceptance criterion for size-selective thoracic coarse particle inlets that precede the sampling filters, as specified by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the International Standards Organization (ISO), and the European Economic Community (CEN). The EPA variant of the thoracic coarse particle acceptance criterion is for PM10, which is essentially the same for particles up to 5 μm, but has a steeper decline for larger-sized particles. The EPA fine particle (PM2.5) sampler acceptance criterion is shown in Figure 7. For inhaled particles that penetrate into the lower respiratory tract (LRT), that is, the airways within the thorax, the deposition patterns and efficiencies within the thoracic conductive airways (trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles) by impaction and sedimentation, and those of particles that deposit in the smaller gas-exchange airways by diffusion, are also highly variable and dependent on particle size, flow rate, and tidal volume, and on in vivo airway dimensions (Lippmann and Albert 1969). Some inhaled particles remain airborne during the tidal breath inhalation and exhalation phases of a tidal breath and are exhaled without having been deposited. There is a deposition minimum of ≈ 15% for particles between 0.1 and 1.0 μm that have little intrinsic mobility, as they are too large to deposit efficiently by diffusion and too small to deposit efficiently by impaction on the surface coatings of larger airway branchings, or to deposit efficiently by sedimentation along the smaller conductive airways. In fact, the tidal flow in the airways is not completely reversible, with ≈ 15% of the inhaled air remaining in the deep lung over multiple breaths and a corresponding volume of residual lung air being exhaled. The laminar flow in the smaller airways leads to deeper penetration of particles near the airway axis than nearer the airway walls, and a flatter flow profile during exhalation, with more of the flow nearer the airway walls being exhaled residual lung air that is depleted of particles, and therefore with much lower particle deposition during exhalation than during inhalation (Briant and Lippmann 1992, 1993).
	- 吸入颗粒物进入胸部受到吸气过程中在URT中沉积的限制，URT随颗粒尺寸分布而变化；流速和潮气量；所述级分通过所述口腔通路；以及体内气道尺寸。所有这些因素因人而异，这取决于年龄、短暂疾病、香烟烟雾暴露和其他导致短暂气道收缩的短期毒物暴露，以及与肺功能丧失或累积损伤相关的职业史因素。图6显示了作为颗粒空气动力学直径函数的健康成人通过口腔通道的颗粒穿透的实验数据。它还显示了美国政府工业卫生学家会议（ACGIH）、国际标准组织（ISO）和欧洲经济共同体（CEN）规定的采样过滤器之前的尺寸选择性胸部粗颗粒入口的采样器验收标准。胸部粗颗粒物验收标准的EPA变体适用于PM10，对于5μm以下的颗粒物基本相同，但对于较大尺寸的颗粒物，其下降幅度更大。EPA细颗粒物（PM2.5）采样器验收标准如图7所示。对于穿透下呼吸道（LRT）的吸入颗粒，即胸部内的气道，通过撞击和沉积在胸部传导气道（气管、支气管和细支气管）内的沉积模式和效率，以及通过扩散沉积在较小气体交换气道中的颗粒的沉积模式，也高度可变，并取决于颗粒大小、流速和潮气量以及体内气道尺寸（Lippmann和Albert 1969）。一些吸入的颗粒在潮汐呼吸的潮汐呼吸吸入和呼气阶段保持在空气中，并且在没有沉积的情况下被呼出。对于内在迁移率很低的0.1至1.0μm之间的颗粒，沉积最小值为≈15%，因为它们太大，无法通过扩散有效沉积，太小，无法通过冲击较大气道分支的表面涂层有效沉积，或无法通过沿较小导电气道的沉积有效沉积。事实上，气道中的潮汐流并不是完全可逆的，在多次呼吸中，≈15%的吸入空气留在深肺，并呼出相应体积的残余肺空气。较小气道中的层流导致颗粒在气道轴附近比在气道壁附近穿透更深，并且在呼气过程中形成更平坦的流动轮廓，更靠近气道壁的流动更多是呼出的颗粒耗尽的残余肺空气，并且因此在呼气期间具有比在吸气期间低得多的颗粒沉积（Briant和Lippmann 1992、1993）。
	- Particles (or aggregates of particles) larger than ≈ 1 μm in aerodynamic diameter deposit in the conductive airways. Those components that are insoluble or poorly soluble on the mucous layer of the airway lining fluid are carried proximally toward the larynx within 1 day, swallowed, pass through the GI tract, and are excreted in the feces. Particles that deposit within oral passages and ciliated nasal passages of the URT are also swallowed and pass through the GI tract where they could contribute to gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms (GERS) and gastroesophageal disease (GERD). Soluble particles, components of particle aggregates, and insoluble particles with diameters < 0.1 μm can all gain access to the bloodstream and be transported to more distal sites, where their chemical composition determines any long-term retention and toxic potential (Lippmann 2014b). Non-hygroscopic insoluble particles < 1 μm and hygroscopic particle < ~2.5 μm that grow in the ambient air and within the airways can deposit in the non-ciliated deep lung airways, where their soluble components can then rapidly enter the bloodstream. Most of the insoluble particles and particulate components > 0.1 μm that reach the non-ciliated deep lung airways are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (AMs); within the few weeks that the macrophages are resident on airway surfaces. These surface macrophages, and the particles within them, are drawn into the terminal bronchioles due to the high surface tension of the lining fluid, and then cleared from the lung conductive airways by mucociliary clearance (Lippmann and Chen 2007). Aspiration of airborne particles into the human respiratory tract is highly particle size dependent. The penetration of inhaled particles into the tracheobronchial tree is different for inhalation via the nose versus the mouth, with the extent of the greater particle penetration of the oral pathway varying with the cross section of the pathway. Most particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 μm that originate from fossil fuel combustion sources can reach the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. By contrast, few WTC Dust particles—having much larger sizes—penetrate that far. The particle-size-dependent differences in deposition sites within the lung airways strongly affect the residence times of the particles at the deposition sites, and their pathways and rates of clearance to other sites within the body. In summary, for conventional occupational and ambient air PM, most of the particles with size between 2.5 and 10 μm deposit in the ciliated larger thoracic airways, where they can elicit bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm that can lead to bronchitis and exacerbations of asthma (discussed in the next section). By contrast, most particles < 2.5 μm that deposit within the thorax are deposited in the more distal non-ciliated gas exchange region where they are more likely to dissolve or be translocated to distal body sites wherein they can then exert organ-system-related toxicities, including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and nervous systems damage.
	- 空气动力学直径大于≈1μm的颗粒（或颗粒聚集体）沉积在导电气道中。那些在气道衬里液的粘膜层上不溶或难溶的成分在1天内被带向喉部近端，吞咽，穿过胃肠道，并在粪便中排出。沉积在URT口腔通道和纤毛鼻腔通道内的颗粒也会被吞咽并穿过胃肠道，在那里它们可能会导致胃食管反流疾病症状（GERS）和胃食管疾病（GERD）。可溶性颗粒、颗粒聚集体的成分和直径小于0.1μm的不溶性颗粒都可以进入血液并被输送到更远端的部位，在那里它们的化学成分决定了任何长期滞留和毒性潜力（Lippmann 2014b）。生长在环境空气和气道内的<1μm的不吸湿不溶性颗粒和<2.5μm的吸湿颗粒可以沉积在无纤毛的深肺气道中，然后它们的可溶性成分可以迅速进入血液。大多数到达无纤毛深肺气道的不溶性颗粒和颗粒成分>0.1μm被肺泡巨噬细胞（AM）吞噬；在巨噬细胞停留在气道表面的几周内。由于衬里液的高表面张力，这些表面巨噬细胞及其内的颗粒被吸入末端细支气管，然后通过粘液纤毛清除从肺传导气道中清除（Lippmann和Chen，2007）。空气中的颗粒物吸入人体呼吸道高度依赖于颗粒大小。通过鼻子和嘴巴吸入的吸入颗粒物进入气管支气管树的程度不同，口腔通道的较大颗粒物穿透程度随着通道的横截面而变化。大多数源自化石燃料燃烧源的空气动力学直径<2.5μm的颗粒可以到达呼吸细支气管和肺泡。相比之下，很少有WTC尘埃颗粒能穿透这么远，它们的尺寸要大得多。肺气道内沉积部位的颗粒大小依赖性差异强烈影响颗粒在沉积部位的停留时间，以及它们通向体内其他部位的途径和清除率。总之，对于传统的职业和环境空气PM，*大多数大小在2.5至10μm之间的颗粒物沉积在有纤毛的较大胸气道中，在那里它们会引起支气管收缩和支气管痉挛，从而导致支气管炎和哮喘恶化（在下一节中讨论）。相比之下，沉积在胸腔内的大多数<2.5μm的颗粒沉积在更远端的无纤毛气体交换区，在那里它们更有可能溶解或转移到远端身体部位，然后在那里它们可以产生器官系统相关的毒性，包括心血管、肝、肾和神经系统损伤*。
- Updated review
	- Studies of effects on deposition of PM can provide a basis for understanding how the inhaled WTC Dusts were deposited in/cleared from the lungs of exposed individuals. WTC Dust contained much more of its PM in the coarse thoracic size range (PM10–2.5), and even greater mass fractions in the PM10–53 and PM >53 size ranges. Further, the alkalinity of the PM in the larger size ranges was greater than in the PM2.5 particles. As a result, because deposition of highly alkaline particles in the URT and in the tracheobronchial airways in the LRT represents a unique challenge to the ability to clear the airways without eliciting adverse effects (such as erosion and death of epithelial cells at airway surfaces), normal defense mechanisms in the larger airways could have been overloaded in individuals who inhaled the WTC Dusts. The concept of lung overload was invoked by Morrow (1988) with respect to lung cancer in the small airways of rats exposed to 7 mg diesel exhaust PM/m3 interfering with the capacity of AM-mediated particle clearance from the small airways. In humans, Lippmann and Timbrell (1990) demonstrated that particle clearance from small airways could be severely disrupted by occupational exposure to amphibole asbestos fibers. Overloading of the capacity of the ciliated epithelium for short-term dust clearance by irritants such as cigaret smoke and for sulfuric acid aerosol exposures has previously been described for the larger conductive airways in humans and donkeys (Albert et al. 1969a,b, 1975, Schlesinger et al. 1978b, Leikauf et al. 1981, 1984, Lippmann et al. 1982, Spektor et al. 1985), for longterm exposures to cigaret smoke in humans and donkeys (Albert et al. 1969a,b, Bohning et al. 1975), and for cigaret smoke in donkeys by Schlesinger et al. (1978b). Disruption of the lung capacity for mucociliary clearance of the tracheobronchial airways by chemical irritants could explain the excess incidences of cough and diseases of the respiratory and GI regions to populations exposed to elevated concentrations of the large-diameter WTC Dust particles that were highly alkaline and capable of damaging or disrupting epithelial cell function. Very high acute exposures and/or lower levels of chronic exposure to chemical irritants can not only disrupt clearance function, but also destroy ciliated and mucus-secreting epithelial cells within the tracheobronchial airways, as has been seen for long-term cigaret smokers, leading to increased retention of all kinds of PM within the lungs, and not just the irritant particles themselves (Schlesinger and Lippmann 1978a). There is also some evidence that human exposure to WTC Dust can cause disruption of mucociliary particle clearance (McMahon et al. 2011). They reported unusual ultrastructural ciliary abnormalities in 3 WTC response workers that corresponded to their respiratory and ciliary functional abnormalities. Each patient had respiratory cilia biopsies that were evaluated for motility and ultrastructural changes. Impaired ciliary motility was seen in 2 of the 3 patients, and each of the patients showed monomorphic ultrastructural abnormalities. Two of them showed identical triangular disarray of axonemal microtubules with peripheral doublets 1, 4, and 7 forming the corners of the triangle and doublet 9 always more medially displaced than doublets 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8. Two workers had cilia in which axonemes were replaced by homogeneously dense cores. One also had cilia with triangular axonemes. The other had cilia with a geometric triangular to pentagonal shape. These ciliary abnormalities may represent a new class of primary ciliary dyskinesia in which abnormalities may have a genetic basis and a phenotypic expression that is prompted at the cellular level by local environmental exposures. Also, there is some evidence that large particles were able to reach deep in the lung, as demonstrated by the electron micrographs of material that was obtained from a firefighter’s lung after bronchoalveolar lavage (Rom et al. 2010).
	- 对PM沉积影响的研究可以为了解吸入的WTC粉尘是如何沉积在暴露个体的肺部/从肺部清除的提供基础。WTC粉尘在胸部粗粒径范围（PM10–2.5）内含有更多的PM，在PM10–53和PM>53粒径范围内含有更大的质量分数。此外，在较大尺寸范围内的PM的碱度大于PM2.5颗粒中的碱度。因此，由于高碱性颗粒在URT和LRT中的气管支气管气道中的沉积对清除气道而不引起不良影响（如气道表面上皮细胞的侵蚀和死亡）的能力提出了独特的挑战，在吸入WTC粉尘的个体中，较大气道中的正常防御机制可能已经过载。Morrow（1988）针对暴露于7 mg柴油废气PM/m3干扰AM介导的小气道颗粒清除能力的大鼠小气道中的肺癌癌症援引了肺过载的概念。在人类身上，Lippmann和Timbrell（1990）证明，职业接触角闪石石棉纤维可能会严重破坏小气道的颗粒清除。纤毛上皮通过刺激物（如香烟烟雾）短期清除灰尘和硫酸气溶胶暴露的能力过载，以前已经描述过人类和驴的较大导电气道（Albert等人1969a，b，1975，Schlesinger等人1978b，Leikauf等人19811984，Lippmann等人1982，Spektor等人1985），人类和驴长期暴露于雪茄烟中（Albert等人，1969a，b，Bohning等人，1975），Schlesinger等人（1978b）对驴烟雾进行了研究。化学刺激物对肺清除气管支气管粘膜纤毛的能力的破坏可以解释暴露于高浓度的大直径WTC粉尘颗粒的人群咳嗽以及呼吸和胃肠道疾病的过度发生，这些颗粒是高度碱性的，能够破坏或破坏上皮细胞功能。非常高的急性暴露和/或较低水平的慢性暴露于化学刺激物不仅会破坏清除功能，还会破坏气管支气管内的纤毛上皮细胞和分泌粘液的上皮细胞，正如长期吸烟者所看到的那样，导致各种PM在肺内的滞留增加，而不仅仅是刺激性颗粒本身（Schlesinger和Lippmann 1978a）。还有一些证据表明，人类接触WTC粉尘会导致粘液纤毛颗粒清除率的破坏（McMahon等人，2011）。他们报告了3名WTC反应工人的异常超微结构纤毛异常，这与他们的呼吸和纤毛功能异常相对应。每个患者都进行了呼吸道纤毛活检，评估其运动性和超微结构变化。3例患者中有2例纤毛运动受损，每例患者均表现出单形态超微结构异常。其中两个显示出相同的轴丝微管三角形混乱，外周双点1、4和7形成三角形的角，双点9总是比双点2、3、5、6和8更向内侧移位。两名工人有纤毛，其中轴突被均匀致密的核心取代。一个也有纤毛和三角形轴突。另一个纤毛呈几何三角形至五边形。这些纤毛异常可能代表一类新的原发性纤毛运动障碍，其中异常可能具有遗传基础和由局部环境暴露在细胞水平上引起的表型表达。此外，有一些证据表明，*大颗粒能够深入肺部，从消防员支气管肺泡灌洗后的肺部获得的材料的电子显微照片证明了这一点*（Rom等人，2010）。
	- In view of the unique particle size distributions and high alkalinity of the WTC Dusts, the standard dosimetry models and data tabulations have proven to be of little value in describing either the acute or cumulative WTC Dust dosages received by individuals or the distributions of doses of population groups who have had inhalation exposures to WTC Dusts in Lower Manhattan. The airborne levels of WTC Dust were highly variable both temporally and spatially, with localized hotspots of exposure being related to human activities causing WTC Dust resuspension. Furthermore, the particle size distribution of the two original WTC Dust clouds from first the South Tower, and then the North Tower, changed with distance due to more rapid settling of the largest particles, and due to the different paths of the high velocity of the airflow radiating out from Ground Zero through the surrounding buildings. Further dose variations were caused by application of respiratory protection to capture the inhalable particles; even gauze masks and handkerchiefs were used to reduce dust penetration into the respiratory tract over the first few hours and days. After the first few days, those people having, and using, well-fitting negative-pressure respirators could avoid inhaling most of the dust in their breathing zone for as long as the dust layer on the filter caused minimal air path clogging. However, those filters worn by indoor cleanup workers often clogged during the course of a 10-h day of cleanup, and replacement cartridges were not always available.
	- 鉴于WTC粉尘的独特粒度分布和高碱度，标准剂量模型和数据表已被证明在描述曼哈顿下城个人接受的WTC粉尘急性或累积剂量或吸入接触过WTC粉尘人群的剂量分布方面几乎没有价值。WTC粉尘的空气传播水平在时间和空间上都高度可变，*局部暴露热点与导致WTC粉尘再悬浮的人类活动有关*。此外，最初从南塔到北塔的两个原始WTC尘埃云的粒径分布随着距离的变化而变化，这是由于最大颗粒的沉降速度更快，以及从世贸中心辐射出的高速气流穿过周围建筑的路径不同。进一步的剂量变化是由应用呼吸保护来捕获可吸入颗粒物引起的；在最初的几个小时和几天里，甚至使用了纱布口罩和手帕来减少灰尘进入呼吸道。在最初的几天之后，只要过滤器上的灰尘层造成的空气通道堵塞最小，那些拥有并使用合适的负压呼吸器的人就可以避免吸入他们呼吸区的大部分灰尘。然而，室内清洁人员佩戴的过滤器在10小时的清洁过程中经常堵塞，而且更换滤芯并不总是可用的。
- Other factors affecting the human dosimetry of inhaled WTC Dusts
	- Oro-nasal Breathing and Airway Anatomy Humans differ from almost all other mammals in terms of being able to inhale via the oral passages as well as through the nose, and in having nearly dichotomous bronchial airway branchings within the lungs rather than the highly asymmetric branching in nearly all other mammals. Both of these differences contribute to enhanced tracheobronchial airway particle deposition in humans (Lippmann 1977). The greater flow resistance through the nasal pathway leads adult humans to switch to oral breathing when engaged in strenuous physical activity at inspiratory flow rates > 40 L/min. When wearing a respirator with its own breathing resistance, there is likely to be a switchover to at least partial oral breathing (oronasal breathing) at a lower flow rate, especially as the respirator filter begins to clog. Partial or total inhalation via the oral passage increases particle penetration into the lungs. The asymmetric branching of the human bronchial airways results in enhanced particle deposition, especially by impaction on the airway bifurcations within them than is characteristic in animals with more asymmetric airway branching (Lippmann and Schlesinger 1984). 2) Enhanced Deposition of Fibers by Interception Fibers, by definition, are particles > 3–5 times longer than they are thick. In the turbulent flow within the larger lung airways their ends are more likely to touch an airway surface and be deposited than a more compact particle of the same aerodynamic diameter, and this enhanced deposition becomes statistically significant for fibers longer than 10 μm (Sussman et al. 1991). 3) Clearance Pathways for Deposited Compact Particles and Fibers The insoluble particles that deposit on the ciliated mucosal surfaces in the nasal and bronchial airways are carried along the surface mucus toward the larynx, where they are swallowed and pass into the GI tract (Albert et al. 1969a). This is the pathway for SVFs within the WTC Dust that deposit within the nasal and oral pathways and the tracheobronchial airways during the first few days after their inhalation. For the cement and gypsum in the WTC Dust, which are soluble within the epithelial surface liquids, they added alkalinity to the mucus as it moved toward the larynx. As such, both the WTC Dusts and the alkaline mucus were likely swallowed and passed into the GI tract. 4) Laceration of Epithelia by SVFs It has long been established that people handling fibrous glass in production facilities and at installation sites can develop dermatitis on exposed skin (Siebert 1942, Enterline et al. 1983, ATSDR 2004). Stokholm et al. (1982) reported that workers exposed to SVF in the form of rockwool had more eye symptoms, and changes in the cellular and mucous conjunctival fluid, breakup time of the precorneal film, the number of microepithelial defects, and the number of dead and degenerated cells on the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva than control workers. One would expect that crushed SVFs within the WTC Dust had a much greater proportion of SVF shards and sharp ends than SVFs handled by production workers and insulation installers. The sharp ends of the SVF fibers and the shards resulting from the crushing of the vitreous fibers could lacerate phagocytic and epithelial cells in and on the lung and GI epithelia, subsequently leading to release of digestive enzymes and further epithelial damage. 5) High pH of Surface Fluids on Airway and Gastroesophageal Tract Epithelia The combination of chemical irritation by the highly alkaline mucus that can damage the ciliated cells of the conductive airways, and the physical irritation caused by the sharp ends of the SVFs, as well as their interactions is a highly likely causal factor for the excess respiratory and GI tract disorders documented in WTC Dust-exposed individuals.
	- Oro-nosal Breaking and Airway Anatomy人类与几乎所有其他哺乳动物的不同之处在于，人类能够通过口腔和鼻子吸气，并且在肺部有几乎二分法的支气管气道分支，而不是几乎所有其他哺乳类动物的高度不对称分支。这两种差异都有助于增强人类气管支气管气道颗粒沉积（Lippmann 1977）。当以>40L/min的吸气流速进行剧烈体力活动时，通过鼻腔通道的较大流动阻力导致成年人转向口腔呼吸。当佩戴具有自身呼吸阻力的呼吸器时，很可能会在较低的流速下切换到至少部分口腔呼吸（口鼻呼吸），尤其是当呼吸器过滤器开始堵塞时。经由口腔通道的部分或全部吸入增加了颗粒进入肺部的渗透。人类支气管气道的不对称分支导致颗粒沉积增强，特别是通过对其内的气道分叉的撞击，而不是气道分支更不对称的动物的特征（Lippmann和Schlesinger 1984）。2） 根据定义，拦截纤维增强沉积纤维是比其厚度长3-5倍的颗粒。在较大肺气道内的湍流中，与具有相同空气动力学直径的更紧凑的颗粒相比，它们的末端更有可能接触气道表面并沉积，并且这种增强的沉积对于长度超过10μm的纤维具有统计学意义（Sussman等人，1991）。3） 沉积的致密颗粒和纤维的清除途径沉积在鼻腔和支气管纤毛粘膜表面的不溶性颗粒沿着表面粘液携带到喉部，在那里被吞咽并进入胃肠道（Albert等人，1969a）。这是WTC粉尘中SVF的途径，在吸入后的最初几天内沉积在鼻腔和口腔通道以及气管支气管内。WTC粉尘中的水泥和石膏可溶于上皮表面液体，当粘液向喉部移动时，它们会为粘液添加碱度。因此，WTC粉尘和碱性粘液都可能被吞咽并进入胃肠道。4） SVF造成的上皮撕裂长期以来，人们已经确定，在生产设施和安装场所处理纤维玻璃的人可能会在暴露的皮肤上患上皮炎（Siebert 1942，Enterline等人1983，ATSDR 2004）。Stokholm等人（1982）报道，与对照工人相比，暴露于岩棉形式的SVF的工人有更多的眼部症状，细胞和粘膜结膜液、角膜前膜破裂时间、微上皮缺陷数量以及角膜和球结膜上死亡和退化细胞数目的变化。人们可以预期，与生产工人和绝缘安装人员处理的SVF相比，WTC Dust中破碎的SVF具有更大比例的SVF碎片和尖锐末端。SVF纤维的尖锐末端和玻璃体纤维粉碎产生的碎片可能撕裂肺和胃肠道上皮中的吞噬细胞和上皮细胞，随后导致消化酶的释放和上皮的进一步损伤。5） 气道和胃食管道上皮表面液体的高pH值高碱性粘液的化学刺激和SVF尖端引起的物理刺激的结合，以及它们的相互作用是WTC粉尘暴露个体中记录的过度呼吸道和胃肠道疾病的极有可能的原因。
- Evidence of WTC dust and Health
	- The extensive peer-reviewed literature discussed in this section documents excesses in both acute and chronic health effects in both 1) rescue and recovery workers and volunteers who were heavily exposed to WTC Dust out-of-doors during the first few days after 9/11; and 2) in residents and local workers, many of whom were heavily exposed to WTC Dust from the initial dust clouds while evacuating, and subsequently from more chronic exposures from resuspended dusts and fumes in the outside streets and from indoor exposures over much longer periods of time. Thus, the people having adverse health effects associated with their exposures to WTC Dust included groups with quite different amounts and temporal patterns of exposure. In spite of their differences in exposure pattern and intensity, the still growing literature on associations of excess clinical disease and dysfunction with known exposure to WTC Dust demonstrates similarities in the effects that they have experienced, and in their causality. The population groups with the highest disease incidence and the most severe responses include those presumed to have been exposed to quite high WTC Dust concentrations and scant use of respirators during the initial rescue and recovery phases, specifically the 1) occupational groups exposed at Ground Zero, many of whom were included in the cohorts studied at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM); 2) FDNY Employees (Firefighters and Emergency Medical Technicians) studied at the NYU Langone Medical Center; and 3) The World Trade Center Day Laborer Medical Monitoring Project at Queens College, for building cleanup workers who did not work at Ground Zero, or live near Ground Zero, but were engaged in cleaning contaminated office/residential buildings in Lower Manhattan. While the incidence rates and severity were generally lower among people going about routine activities in Lower Manhattan, they still had statistically significant excesses in some of the same adverse health responses. Less is known about the local residents and workers; however, dose–response relationships for adverse health effects have been shown for these populations as well (Lin et al. 2007, Maslow et al. 2012). There were also clinical examinations of additional population groups who were presumed to have had exposures to lesser concentrations of WTC Dust initially, but whose periods of exposure extended into subsequent months. These groups included 1) residents and office workers in Lower Manhattan studied at NYU; and 2) the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene health registry of over 71,000 people for long-term follow-up studies to document medical problems of NYC responders and volunteers (WTC Health Registry 2012). In addition, there were a variety of population groups that were not given clinical examinations whose exposures to WTC Dusts were less well defined, and whose adverse effects were elicited by questionnaires. Despite different temporal patterns of WTC Dust exposure, and different frequencies of disease expression, both in terms of short-term and longer-term responses, all of these population groups exhibited quite similar clusters of specific disease categories within three specific anatomic regions, that is, the 1) upper respiratory; 2) lower respiratory; and 3) GI tracts. One of the clear early results of working in indoor or outdoor areas where WTC Dust contamination was substantial was a persistent cough, called “WTC cough” (Chen and Thurston 2002). This “cough” was accompanied by bronchial hyper-reactivity and respiratory distress (Prezant et al. 2002) in 8% of the highly exposed firefighters examined at NYU. Of the 332 firefighters having “WTC cough,” 95% had symptoms of shortness of breath; 87% had GERD; and 54% had nasal symptoms. The different population groups also had elevated incidences of chronic diseases that developed in the same three anatomic regions, as discussed below. The World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) was mandated to identify health conditions linked by epidemiology and health research studies to occupational exposures to WTC Dusts (Howard 2014). It is considered an authoritative source for judging what health problems suffered by WTC workers and volunteers are eligible to receive medical care. Further, the WTCHP developed its list of aerodigestive illnesses based on epidemiological research findings published in the peer-reviewed literature that could be linked to exposure to WTC Dust exposure: asthma, chronic cough syndrome, chronic laryngitis, chronic nasopharyngitis, chronic respiratory disorder, chronic rhinosinusitis, GERD, interstitial lung diseases, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), sleep apnea, upper airway hyperreactivity, and WTC-exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
	- 本节讨论的大量同行评审文献记录了1）在9/11事件后的头几天，救援和恢复人员以及志愿者在户外严重暴露于WTC粉尘中，对急性和慢性健康的过度影响；以及2）在居民和当地工人中，他们中的许多人在疏散时严重暴露于最初尘埃云产生的WTC灰尘，随后又长期暴露于室外街道上重新悬浮的灰尘和烟雾以及更长时间的室内暴露。因此，与接触WTC粉尘相关的不良健康影响人群包括接触量和时间模式截然不同的人群。尽管他们在接触模式和强度上存在差异，但关于过度临床疾病和功能障碍与已知接触WTC粉尘的关联的文献仍在不断增加，这表明他们所经历的影响及其因果关系存在相似之处。疾病发病率最高、反应最严重的人群包括那些被认为在最初的救援和恢复阶段暴露于相当高的WTC粉尘浓度和很少使用呼吸器的人群，特别是1）暴露在归零地的职业群体，其中许多人被纳入西奈山医学院（MSSM）研究的队列中；2） FDNY员工（消防员和急救医疗技术人员）在纽约大学朗格尼医疗中心学习；以及3）皇后学院的世界贸易中心日工医疗监测项目，针对那些不在归零地工作或住在归零地附近，但在曼哈顿下城从事清洁受污染的办公楼/住宅楼的建筑清洁工人。虽然在曼哈顿下城进行日常活动的人的发病率和严重程度通常较低，但在一些相同的不良健康反应中，他们仍然有统计学上显著的过度反应。对当地居民和工人的了解较少；然而，这些人群的不良健康影响的剂量-反应关系也已得到证明（Lin等人，2007，Maslow等人，2012）。此外，还对其他人群进行了临床检查，这些人群最初被认为接触过较低浓度的WTC粉尘，但其接触期延长到随后的几个月。这些群体包括1）在纽约大学学习的曼哈顿下城的居民和上班族；以及2）纽约市卫生和精神卫生部的71000多人健康登记处，用于记录纽约市响应者和志愿者的医疗问题的长期随访研究（WTC健康登记处2012）。此外，还有各种未接受临床检查的人群，他们接触WTC粉尘的情况不太清楚，其不良影响是通过问卷调查得出的。尽管WTC粉尘暴露的时间模式不同，疾病表达的频率也不同，无论是在短期还是长期反应方面，所有这些人群在三个特定解剖区域内都表现出非常相似的特定疾病类别集群，即：1）上呼吸道；2） 下呼吸道；和3）胃肠道。在WTC粉尘污染严重的室内或室外区域工作的一个明显的早期结果是持续咳嗽，称为“WTC咳嗽”（Chen和Thurston，2002年）。在纽约大学接受检查的8%的高暴露消防员中，这种“咳嗽”伴随着支气管高反应性和呼吸窘迫（Prezant等人，2002）。在332名“WTC咳嗽”的消防员中，95%有呼吸急促的症状；87%患有胃食管反流病；54%有鼻部症状。不同人群在同三个解剖区域发生的慢性病发病率也有所上升，如下所述。世界贸易中心卫生计划（WTCHP）被授权确定流行病学和健康研究与职业接触WTC粉尘有关的健康状况（Howard 2014）。它被认为是判断WTC工作人员和志愿者有哪些健康问题有资格接受医疗护理的权威来源。此外，WTCHP根据同行评审文献中发表的可能与接触WTC粉尘有关的流行病学研究结果，制定了其空气消化系统疾病清单：哮喘、慢性咳嗽综合征、慢性喉炎、慢性鼻咽炎、慢性呼吸系统紊乱、慢性鼻窦炎、胃食管反流病、间质性肺病，反应性气道功能障碍综合征（RADS）、睡眠呼吸暂停、上呼吸道高反应性和WTC加重了慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）。
- Groups with results based on clinical observations
	- In this section, we summarize the health effects reported for people exposed to WTC Dust in Lower Manhattan. In doing so, we focused on the objective findings of adverse health effects in the literature to a greater extent than on the conclusions of the authors of the published reports on the basis that they were often narrowly focused on the specific population being studied, and on the limited statistical power of the study. The MSSM established a clinically based research center in NYC to measure the health risks among workers and volunteers post-WTC Tower collapse on September 11, 2001, that is, the WTC Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program (The WTC Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program (WVMS) provided free, standardized medical assessments, clinical referrals, and occupational health education for workers and volunteers exposed to hazards during the WTC rescue and recovery effort). It provided free, standardized medical assessments, clinical referrals, and occupational health education for workers and volunteers exposed to hazards during the WTC rescue and recovery effort. Levin et al. (2004) reported that during July 16, 2002 to August 6, 2004, the WVMS evaluated 11,768 non-FDNY workers and volunteers. Data analyzed from a subset of 1,138 of the 11,768 participants evaluated at MSSM during July 16 to December 31, 2002 indicated that a substantial proportion of participants experienced new-onset or worsened preexisting lower and upper respiratory symptoms, with frequent persistence of symptoms for months after their WTC work stopped. 46% of them worked on September 11, 2001, and 84% worked or volunteered during September 11–14, when exposures were greatest. During that period, 21% reported using respiratory protection (i.e., full- or half-face respirators). The median length of time worked on the WTC effort was 966 (range: 24–4,080) h. Of the 610 examinees present in Lower Manhattan on September 11, 51% reported being directly in the cloud of dust created by the collapse of the WTC buildings, and an additional 31% reported exposure to substantial amounts of dust. WTC-related lower respiratory symptoms were reported by 60%, and 74% reported WTC-related upper respiratory symptoms: 40% had WTC-incident lower respiratory symptoms that persisted to the month before screening, and 50% reported WTC-incident and persistent upper respiratory symptoms. Among the 851 participants who reported persistent WTC-related symptoms, an average of 32 (range: 7–63) weeks had elapsed since they stopped working at the site or the end of May 2002. Of all the participants, 46% had nasal mucosal inflammation, but other respiratory abnormalities (e.g., abnormal nasal turbinates or sinuses, rhonchi, and wheezing) were less common. Landrigan et al. (2004) studied the health of 183 workers at MSSM, and 32.8% of them experienced new cough after starting WTC Dust cleanup; 24% had new phlegm production; and 17.5% had de novo wheezing.
	- 在本节中，我们总结了曼哈顿下城接触WTC粉尘的人的健康影响报告。在这样做的过程中，我们在更大程度上关注文献中关于不良健康影响的客观发现，而不是已发表报告的作者的结论，因为他们往往狭隘地关注所研究的特定人群，以及研究的统计能力有限。MSSM于2001年9月11日在纽约市建立了一个基于临床的研究中心，以衡量世贸大厦倒塌后*工人和志愿者的健康风险*，即世贸大厦工人和志愿者医疗筛查计划，以及为WTC救援和恢复工作中暴露于危险的工人和志愿者提供职业健康教育）。它为WTC救援和恢复工作中暴露在危险中的工人和志愿者提供免费、标准化的医疗评估、临床转诊和职业健康教育。Levin等人（2004年）报告称，在2002年7月16日至2004年8月6日期间，WVMS评估了11768名非FDNY工作人员和志愿者。从2002年7月16日至12月31日期间在MSSM评估的11768名参与者中的1138人的子集分析的数据表明，相当大比例的参与者经历了新的发作或先前存在的下呼吸道和上呼吸道症状恶化，在他们的WTC工作停止后，症状经常持续数月。其中46%的人在2001年9月11日工作，84%的人在暴露量最大的9月11至14日期间工作或志愿服务。在此期间，21%的人报告使用了呼吸保护装置（即全脸或半脸呼吸器）。WTC的平均工作时间为966小时（范围：24-4080）。9月11日，在曼哈顿下城的610名考生中，51%的人报告说直接处于WTC建筑倒塌产生的尘埃云中，另有31%的人报告称暴露在大量灰尘中。60%的患者报告了WTC相关的下呼吸道症状，74%的患者报告WTC相关上呼吸道症状：40%的患者出现WTC事件下呼吸道症状并持续到筛查前一个月，50%的患者报告有WTC事件和持续的上呼吸道症状。在851名报告持续WTC相关症状的参与者中，自他们停止在现场工作或2002年5月底以来，平均已经过去了32周（范围：7-63）。在所有参与者中，46%的人有鼻粘膜炎症，但其他呼吸系统异常（如鼻甲或鼻窦异常、发汗和喘息）不太常见。Landrigan等人（2004）研究了MSSM 183名工人的健康状况，其中32.8%的工人在开始WTC粉尘清理后出现新的咳嗽；24%有新痰生成；17.5%为新发喘息。
	- Skloot et al. (2004) studied 96 male ironworkers from the MSSM study group, including their exposures, medical histories, physical examinations, spirometry, and chest radiographs. The average age was 43 years, 83% were White, and 65% were current or former smokers. Cough was the most common symptom, upper and lower pulmonary complaints were common among almost half of the men, and 41 subjects wore no respiratory protection; 19 workers had abnormal radiographs. Cough was more common among those who began work on 9/11 compared with those who arrived later, 78% versus 54%. Spirometry did not differ between smokers and non-smokers, and those who wore respiratory protection seemed to have less respiratory symptoms than those who did not. They found a significant OR between cough and exposure during 9/11, OR = 3.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.35– 9.83. Lung function tests were not associated with exposure duration or onset. Herbstman et al. (2005) studied 183 WTC cleanup and recovery workers, mostly truck drivers, carpenters/mechanics, dock workers, and supervisors/laborers. Most of the participants were male, 65% White, 50% truck or heavy equipment operators, 91% reported wearing a respirator some of their working time, and an equal fraction were current or never smokers ≈ 36%. They divided the group according to whether they had respiratory symptoms (64 subjects or 35%) or not (119 subjects or 65%) when they began working at the WTC site. They reported that 31% and 34% of the groups with existing illnesses and symptom free developed new cough; 23% and 24% developed new phlegm; and 16% and 19% developed de novo wheeze. New-onset cough among those without pulmonary symptoms was the only symptom that followed an exposure–response pattern with those with the greatest number of days having the highest prevalence. Those with extant respiratory symptoms had a greater prevalence of new upper respiratory conditions (such as nasal congestion, sore throat, and hoarseness). Smoking seemed to play no apparent role in the findings. They noted that cough receptors were located in the larynx and larger airways, and the complex of large-sized PM and alkalinity accounted for cough being so prominent a symptom. Herbert et al. (2006) gathered background information for later epidemiology studies of chronic respiratory diseases resulting from exposures to WTC Dust. They helped to create a clinical center at MSSM to study the health of workers not covered by other medical programs such as those of the FDNY, federal employees, and NYS rescue workers. The MSSM program drew patients from several other clinics in New York and New Jersey, and all agreed to follow the same protocol. Eligible workers or volunteers had to have worked 4 h on September 11, 24 h during September 2001, or 80 h any time within the September– December time frame. All were examined clinically, completed a standardized medical questionnaire and a pulmonary function assessment, and provided responses about their health before and after 9/11. Of the 9,442 study participants, 86.7% were male, 65.7% White, 86% union members, and most were construction (34.0%) or law enforcement workers (29.4%). There were also 258 cleaning and maintenance workers (2.7%). All subjects had fewer lower or upper respiratory symptoms before than after 9/11. These symptoms tended to clearly show a greater risk for those whose exposures to WTC Dust happened in the first few weeks. However, even subjects who arrived after October 1, 2001 had a prevalence of 41% for lower respiratory symptoms (~ 3 times greater than prior to 9/11) and a prevalence of 59% for upper respiratory conditions (nearly 2 times the percentage prior to 9/11). When pulmonary function was assessed, they had low FVC. Among the 4,641 never smokers, there was more than twice the prevalence of lowered pulmonary function tests (PFTs) compared with US White males (27% vs. 13%). Time of arrival was correlated with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC), with those arriving on 9/11 having much poorer FVC than those arriving October 1 or later.
	- Skloot等人（2004）研究了来自MSSM研究组的96名男性钢铁工人，包括他们的暴露、病史、体检、肺活量测定和胸部射线照片。平均年龄为43岁，83%为白人，65%为现任或前任吸烟者。咳嗽是最常见的症状，上下肺部主诉在近一半的男性中很常见，41名受试者没有佩戴呼吸保护装置；19名工人的射线照片异常。咳嗽在9/11开始工作的人中比晚到的人更常见，分别为78%和54%。吸烟者和非吸烟者的肺活量测量没有差异，佩戴呼吸保护装置的人似乎比没有佩戴的人呼吸系统症状更少。他们发现，在9/11期间，咳嗽和暴露之间存在显著的OR，OR=3.64，95%置信区间（CI）为1.35–9.83。肺功能测试与暴露时间或发病无关。Herbstman等人（2005）研究了183名WTC清理和恢复工人，其中大部分是卡车司机、木匠/机械师、码头工人和监督员/工人。大多数参与者是男性，65%是白人，50%是卡车或重型设备操作员，91%的人报告说他们在工作时间戴着口罩，同样一部分人是目前或从未吸烟的人≈36%。他们根据开始在WTC工作时是否有呼吸道症状（64名受试者，占35%）或是否有呼吸道疾病症状（119名受试人，占65%）来分组。他们报告说，31%和34%的现有疾病和无症状的群体出现了新的咳嗽；23%和24%出现新痰；16%和19%出现新发喘息。在没有肺部症状的人群中，新发咳嗽是唯一遵循暴露-反应模式的症状，天数最多的人群患病率最高。那些有现存呼吸道症状的人出现新的上呼吸道疾病（如鼻塞、喉咙痛和声音嘶哑）的几率更高。吸烟似乎在这一发现中没有起到明显的作用。他们指出，咳嗽受体位于喉部和较大的气道中，大颗粒物和碱度的复合物是咳嗽如此突出的症状的原因。Herbert等人（2006）收集了背景信息，用于后期对接触WTC粉尘引起的慢性呼吸道疾病进行流行病学研究。他们帮助在MSSM建立了一个临床中心，研究其他医疗项目未涵盖的工作人员的健康状况，如FDNY、联邦雇员和NYS救援人员。MSSM项目吸引了来自纽约和新泽西州其他几家诊所的患者，他们都同意遵循相同的方案。符合条件的工人或志愿者必须在9月11日工作4小时，在2001年9月工作24小时，或在9月至12月的任何时间工作80小时。所有人都接受了临床检查，完成了标准化的医学问卷和肺功能评估，并提供了关于9/11前后健康状况的回复。在9442名研究参与者中，86.7%是男性，65.7%是白人，86%是工会成员，大多数是建筑工人（34.0%）或执法人员（29.4%）。还有258名清洁和维护工人（2.7%）。所有受试者在9/11之前或之后的下呼吸道或上呼吸道症状都较少。这些症状往往清楚地表明，对于那些在最初几周内接触WTC粉尘的人来说，风险更大。然而，即使是2001年10月1日之后抵达的受试者，下呼吸道症状的患病率也为41%（比9/11之前高出约3倍），上呼吸道疾病的患病率为59%（几乎是9/11之前的2倍）。当评估肺功能时，他们的FVC较低。在4641名从不吸烟者中，肺功能测试降低的患病率是美国白人男性的两倍多（27%对13%）。抵达时间与强迫肺活量（FVC）降低相关，9月11日抵达的人的FVC比10月1日或之后抵达的人差得多。

## 1.1 General PM Pollution

### Components of Air Pollution and Cognitive Function in Middleaged and Older Adults in Los Angeles  2014 

While experiments in animals demonstrate neurotoxic effects of particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O3), epidemiologic evidence is sparse regarding the relationship between different constituencies of air pollution mixtures and cognitive function in adults. We examined crosssectional associations between various ambient air pollutants [O3, PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] and six measures of cognitive function and global cognition among healthy, cognitively intact individuals (n=1,496, mean age 60.5 years) residing in the Los Angeles Basin. Air pollution exposures were assigned to each residential address in 2000–06 using a geographic information system that included monitoring data. A neuropsychological battery was used to assess cognitive function; a principal components analysis defined six domain-specific functions and a measure of global cognitive function was created. Regression models estimated effects of air pollutants on cognitive function, adjusting for age, gender, race, education, income, study and mood. Increasing exposure to PM2.5 was associated with lower verbal learning (β = −0.32 per 10 ug/m3 PM2.5, 95% CI = −0.63, 0.00; p = 0.05). Ambient exposure to NO2 >20 ppb tended to be associated with lower logical memory. Compared to the lowest level of exposure to ambient O3, exposure above 49 ppb was associated with lower executive function. Including carotid artery intima-media thickness, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis, in models as a possible mediator did not attenuate effect estimates. This study provides support for cross-sectional associations between increasing levels of ambient O3, PM2.5 and NO2 and measures of domain-specific cognitive abilities. 虽然在动物身上的实验证明了颗粒物(PM)和臭氧(O3)的神经毒性作用，但关于空气污染混合物的不同成分与成年人认知功能之间的关系，流行病学证据很少。 我们研究了居住在洛杉矶盆地的健康、认知完整的个体(n=1,496,平均年龄60.5岁）中各种环境空气污染物[O3、PM2.5和二氧化氮(NO2)]之间的横断面联系以及认知功能和全球认知的六项测量。 在2000至06年度，我们使用包括监测数据在内的地理信息系统，将空气污染暴露量分配给每个居住地址。 使用神经心理学电池评估认知功能； 一个主成分分析定义了六个领域特定的功能，并建立了一个整体认知功能的度量。 回归模型根据年龄、性别、种族、教育程度、收入、学习和情绪，估计空气污染物对认知功能的影响。 暴露于PM2.5的增加与言语学习能力下降有关(β=-0.32每10 ug/m3 PM2.5,95%CI=-0.63,0.00；P=0.05)。 环境暴露于NO2>20 ppb往往与低逻辑记忆有关。 与暴露于环境O3的最低水平相比，暴露在49 ppb以上与执行功能下降有关。 包括颈动脉内中膜厚度，一种亚临床动脉粥样硬化的测量，作为一种可能的介导因素，在模型中并没有减弱效果估计。 这项研究为环境O3、PM2.5和NO2水平的增加与特定领域认知能力的测量之间的横截面联系提供了支持。 

  

### Fine Particulate Matter Air Pollution and Cognitive Function Among Older US Adults  2014 

Existing research on the adverse health effects of exposure to pollution has devoted relatively little attention to the potential impact of ambient air pollution on cognitive function in older adults. We examined the cross-sectional association between residential concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μmorless (PM2.5) and cognitive function in older adults. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we analyzed data from the 2004 Health and Retirement Study, a large, nationally representative sample of US adults aged 50 years or older. We linked participant data with 2000 US Census tract data and 2004 census tract–level annual average PM2.5 concentrations. Older adults living in areas with higher PM2.5 concentrations had worse cognitive function (β = −0.26, 95% confidence interval: −0.47, −0.05) even after adjustment for community- and individual-level social and economic characteristics. Results suggest that the association is strongest for the episodic memory component of cognitive function. This study adds to a growing body of research highlighting the importance of air pollution to cognitive function in older adults. Improving air quality in large metropolitan areas, where much of the aging US population resides, may be an important mechanism for reducing age-related cognitive decline. 现有的关于暴露于污染对健康不利影响的研究相对较少关注环境空气污染对老年人认知功能的潜在影响。 我们研究了空气动力直径为2.5μmorless(PM2.5)的居民颗粒物浓度与老年人认知功能之间的横截面关系。 使用分层线性模型，我们分析了2004年健康和退休研究的数据，这是一个大型的，全国代表性的50岁或以上的美国成年人样本。 我们将参与者的数据与2000年美国人口普查区域数据和2004年人口普查区域水平的年平均PM2.5浓度联系起来。 即使在调整了社区和个人层面的社会和经济特征后，生活在PM2.5浓度较高地区的老年人的认知功能也较差(β=-0.26，95%置信区间:-0.47，-0.05)。 结果表明，认知功能中的情景记忆成分的关联性最强。 这项研究增加了越来越多的研究，强调空气污染对老年人认知功能的重要性。 改善大城市地区的空气质量可能是减少与年龄相关的认知能力下降的一个重要机制，而这些地区是美国大部分老龄化人口居住的地方。 

###  Long-term PM2.5 Exposure and Neurological Hospital Admissions in the Northeastern United States 2016 

Background: Long-term exposure to fine particles (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5) has been consistently linked to heart and lung disease. Recently, there has been increased interest in examining the effects of air pollution on the nervous system, with evidence showing potentially harmful effects on neurodegeneration. Objective: Our objective was to assess the potential impact of long-term PM2.5 exposure on event time, defined as time to first admission for dementia, Alzheimer’s (AD), or Parkinson’s (PD) diseases in an elderly population across the northeastern United States. Methods: We estimated the effects of PM2.5 on first hospital admission for dementia, AD, and PD among all Medicare enrollees ≥ 65 years in 50 northeastern U.S. cities (1999–2010). For each outcome, we first ran a Cox proportional hazards model for each city, adjusting for prior cardiopulmonary-related hospitalizations and year, and stratified by follow-up time, age, sex, and race. We then pooled the city-specific estimates by employing a random effects meta-regression. Results: We followed approximately 9.8 million subjects and observed significant associations of long-term PM2.5 city-wide exposure with all three outcomes. Specifically, we estimated a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.11) for dementia, an HR of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.19) for AD, and an HR of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.12) for PD admissions per 1‑μg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 concentrations. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between longterm exposure to PM2.5 and time to first hospitalization for common neurodegenerative diseases. We found strong evidence of association for all three outcomes. Our findings provide the basis for further studies, as the implications of such exposures could be crucial to public health. 背景：长期接触细颗粒物（颗粒物≤2.5μm；PM2.5)一直与心肺疾病有关。 最近，研究空气污染对神经系统的影响越来越引起人们的兴趣，有证据表明空气污染对神经退化有潜在的有害影响。 目的：我们的目的是评估长期PM2.5暴露对事件时间的潜在影响，事件时间定义为美国东北部老年人群中痴呆症、阿尔茨海默病(AD)或帕金森病(PD)的首次入院时间。 方法：我们评估了美国东北部50个城市（1999-2010）中PM2.5对≥65岁的所有医疗保险参保者中痴呆、AD和PD首次住院的影响。 对于每个结果，我们首先在每个城市运行考克斯比例风险模型，调整以前的心肺相关住院和年份，并按随访时间、年龄、性别和种族分层。 然后，我们通过使用随机效应元回归来汇集特定城市的估计值。 结果：我们跟踪了大约980万名受试者，观察到全市范围内长期PM2.5暴露与所有三种结果之间的显著关联。 具体而言，我们估计每年PM2.5浓度每增加1微克/立方米，痴呆症的危险比为1.08(95%CI:1.05,1.11)，AD的危险比为1.15(95%CI:1.11,1.19)，PD的危险比为1.08(95%CI:1.04,1.12）。 结论：据我们所知，这是首次研究长期暴露于PM2.5与常见神经退行性疾病首次住院时间之间的关系。 我们发现了这三种结果之间存在关联的有力证据。 我们的发现为进一步的研究提供了基础，因为这种接触的影响可能对公共健康至关重要。 

  

###  Neighborhood Psychosocial Stressors, Air Pollution, and Cognitive Function among Older U.S. Adults 2016

A growing number of studies have found a link between outdoor air pollution and cognitive function among older adults. Psychosocial stress is considered an important factor determining differential susceptibility to environmental hazards and older adults living in stressful neighborhoods may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse health effects of exposure to hazards such as air pollution. The objective of this study is to determine if neighborhood social stress amplifies the association between fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and poor cognitive function in older, community-dwelling adults. We use data on 779 U.S. adults ages 55 and older from the 2001/2002 wave of the Americans’ Changing Lives study. We determined annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2001 in the area of residence by linking respondents with EPA air monitoring data using census tract identifiers. Cognitive function was measured using the number of errors on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Exposure to neighborhood social stressors was measured using perceptions of disorder and decay and included subjective evaluations of neighborhood upkeep and the presence of deteriorating/abandoned buildings, trash, and empty lots. We used negative binomial regression to examine the interaction of neighborhood perceived stress and PM2.5 on the count of errors on the cognitive function assessment. We found that the association between PM2.5 and cognitive errors was stronger among older adults living in high stress neighborhoods. These findings support recent theoretical developments in environmental health and health disparities research emphasizing the synergistic effects of neighborhood social stressors and environmental hazards on residents’ health. Those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, where social stressors and environmental hazards are more common, may be particularly susceptible to adverse health effects of social and physical environmental exposures. 越来越多的研究发现室外空气污染和老年人的认知功能之间有联系。 社会心理压力被认为是决定对环境危害的不同易感性的一个重要因素，生活在有压力社区的老年人可能特别容易受到暴露于空气污染等危害的不利健康影响。 这项研究的目的是确定邻里社会压力是否会放大细颗粒物空气污染(PM2.5)与社区老年人认知功能不良之间的联系。 我们使用2001/2002年美国人改变生活的浪潮研究中的779名55岁及以上的美国成年人的数据。 我们利用普查域标识符将受访者与美国环保局的空气监测数据联系起来，确定了2001年居住地区的年平均PM2.5浓度。 采用简易便携式心理状态问卷(SPMSQ)的错误数测量认知功能。 暴露于社区的社会压力源是通过对混乱和腐烂的感知来测量的，包括对社区维护和存在恶化/废弃的建筑、垃圾和空地的主观评价。 我们用负二项回归检验邻里知觉压力与PM2.5在认知功能评定误差计数上的交互作用。 我们发现，在生活在高压力社区的老年人中，PM2.5和认知错误之间的联系更强。 这些发现支持了环境健康和健康差异研究的最新理论发展，强调邻里社会压力源和环境危害对居民健康的协同作用。 那些生活在社会经济困难社区的人，在那里社会压力和环境危害更常见，可能特别容易受到社会和物质环境暴露的不利健康影响。 

  

###  Particulate air pollutants, APOE alleles and their contributions to cognitive impairment in older women and to amyloidogenesis in experimental models 2017

Exposure to particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air and its interactions with APOE alleles may contribute to the acceleration of brain aging and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurodegenerative effects of particulate air pollutants were examined in a US-wide cohort of older women from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and in experimental mouse models. Residing in places with fine PM exceeding EPA standards increased the risks for global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia respectively by 81 and 92%, with stronger adverse effects in APOE ε4/4 carriers. Female EFAD transgenic mice (5xFAD+/−/human APOE ε3 or ε4+/+) with 225 h exposure to urban nanosized PM (nPM) over 15 weeks showed increased cerebral β-amyloid by thioflavin S for fibrillary amyloid and by immunocytochemistry for Aβ deposits, both exacerbated by APOE ε4. Moreover, nPM exposure increased Aβ oligomers, caused selective atrophy of hippocampal CA1 neurites, and decreased the glutamate GluR1 subunit. Wildtype C57BL/6 female mice also showed nPM-induced CA1 atrophy and GluR1 decrease. In vitro nPM exposure of neuroblastoma cells (N2a-APP/swe) increased the pro-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We suggest that airborne PM exposure promotes pathological brain aging in older women, with potentially a greater impact in ε4 carriers. The underlying mechanisms may involve increased cerebral Aβ production and selective changes in hippocampal CA1 neurons and glutamate receptor subunits. 大气颗粒物(PM)暴露及其与ApoE等位基因的相互作用可能是加速脑衰老和阿尔茨海默病(AD)发病的重要原因。 通过妇女健康倡议记忆研究(WHIMS)在全美范围内的老年妇女队列和实验性小鼠模型中检查了颗粒空气污染物的神经退行性影响。 居住在细颗粒物超过EPA标准的地方，全球认知功能衰退和全因性痴呆的风险分别增加81%和92%，其中ApoEε4/4携带者的不良影响更强。 雌性EFAD转基因小鼠(5xFAD+/-/人ApoEε3或ε4+/+)在城市纳米PM(NPM)中暴露225小时超过15周，硫黄素S引起的纤维淀粉样蛋白和Aβ沉积引起的脑β-淀粉样蛋白增加，而ApoEε4加剧了这两种物质。 NPM暴露使海马CA1神经元Aβ低聚物增多，选择性萎缩，谷氨酸GluR1亚基降低。 野生型C57BL/6雌性小鼠也出现NPM诱导的CA1萎缩和GluR1下降。 NPM暴露于神经母细胞瘤细胞(N2A-APP/SWE)后，可促进淀粉样前体蛋白(APP)的淀粉样前体蛋白生成。 我们认为空气中的PM暴露促进老年妇女病理性脑老化，对ε4携带者可能有更大的影响。 其机制可能与脑Aβ生成增加、海马CA1神经元和谷氨酸受体亚基选择性改变有关。 

  

###  Exposure to ambient air pollution and the incidence of dementia: A population-based cohort study 2017

Introduction: Emerging studies have implicated air pollution in the neurodegenerative processes. Less is known about the influence of air pollution, especially at the relatively low levels, on developing dementia. We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, where the concentrations of pollutants are among the lowest in the world, to assess whether air pollution exposure is associated with incident dementia. Methods: The study population comprised all Ontario residents who, on 1 April 2001, were 55–85 years old, Canadian-born, and free of physician-diagnosed dementia (~2.1 million individuals). Follow-up extended until 2013. We used population-based health administrative databases with a validated algorithm to ascertain incident diagnosis of dementia as well as prevalent cases. Using satellite observations, land-use regression model, and an optimal interpolation method, we derived long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (≤2.5 μm in diameter) (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), respectively at the subjects' historical residences based on a population-based registry. We used multilevel spatial random-effects Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for individual and contextual factors, such as diabetes, brain injury, and neighborhood income. We conducted various sensitivity analyses, such as lagging exposure up to 10 years and considering a negative control outcome for which no (or weaker) association with air pollution is expected. Results: We identified 257,816 incident cases of dementia in 2001–2013. We found a positive association between PM2.5 and dementia incidence, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.05) for every interquartile-range increase in exposure to PM2.5. Similarly, NO2 was associated with increased incidence of dementia (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.08–1.12). No association was found for O3. These associations were robust to all sensitivity analyses examined. These estimates translate to 6.1% of dementia cases (or 15,813 cases) attributable to PM2.5 and NO2, based on the observed distribution of exposure relative to the lowest quartile in concentrations in this cohort. Discussion: In this large cohort, exposure to air pollution, even at the relative low levels, was associated with higher dementia incidence. 导言：新兴的研究已经将空气污染与神经退行性病变过程联系起来。 关于空气污染的影响，尤其是在相对较低的水平上，对痴呆症的影响知之甚少。 我们在加拿大安大略省进行了一项基于人群的队列研究，该地区的污染物浓度是世界上最低的，以评估空气污染暴露是否与偶发痴呆有关。 方法：研究对象为2001年4月1日所有安大略省居民，年龄55～85岁，加拿大出生，无医生诊断的痴呆（约210万人）。 后续行动延长至2013年。 我们使用基于人口的健康管理数据库和一个有效的算法来确定痴呆的事件诊断以及流行病例。 利用卫星观测、土地利用回归模型和最优插值方法，我们在基于人口的登记基础上，分别得出了受试者历史居住地细颗粒物(≤2.5μm)(PM2.5)、二氧化氮(NO2)和臭氧(O3)的长期平均暴露量。 我们使用了多级空间随机效应Cox比例风险模型，调整了个人和背景因素，如糖尿病、脑损伤和邻里收入。 我们进行了各种敏感性分析，如滞后暴露长达10年，并考虑预期与空气污染没有（或更弱）联系的阴性控制结果。 结果：我们在2001-2013年发现了257,816例痴呆事件。 我们发现PM2.5与痴呆发病率之间存在正相关，每增加一个四分位数范围内的PM2.5暴露，危险比(HR)为1.04(95%置信区间(CI):1.03-1.05)。 同样，NO2与痴呆发病率增加有关(HR=1.10；95%CI:1.08-1.12)。 与O3无关联。 这些关联在所有敏感性分析中都是稳健的。 根据观察到的相对于该队列中最低四分位数浓度的暴露分布，这些估计数相当于6.1%的痴呆症病例（或15,813例）可归因于PM2.5和NO2。 讨论：在这个大队列中，暴露于空气污染，即使是相对较低的水平，也与较高的痴呆发病率有关。 

###  Long-term Effect of Fine Particulate Matter on Hospitalization with Dementia 2019

Background—New evidence suggests that PM2.5 is associated with late onset dementia (LOD). However, epidemiological studies for the entire population have not been implemented yet. Methods—We utilized approximately 94 million follow-up records from fee-for-service Medicare records for 13 million Medicare beneficiaries residing in the southeastern U.S. from 2000 to 2013. For exposure to PM2.5, we used spatially and temporally continuous data that improved those from monitors. To account for time-varying PM2.5 levels, the Cox model with the Andersen-Gill counting process was applied. Stratified analyses by subtype of dementia and levels of urbanization of residence were performed. Results—During a median follow-up of 6 years, 1,409,599 hospitalizations for dementia occurred. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalization with dementia was 1.049 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.048 to 1.051) per 1 μg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5. In particular, the hazard ratio for vascular dementia (HR, 1.086; 95% CI, 1.082 to 1.090) was high. The magnitude of the effect grew as the level of urbanization increased (HR, 1.036; 95% CI, 1.031 to 1.041 in rural areas versus HR, 1.052; 95% CI, 1.050 to 1.054 in metropolitan areas). Conclusions—Long-term exposure to higher PM2.5 was associated with increased hospitalizations with dementia. 背景-新的证据表明PM2.5与痴呆症(LOD)有关。 然而，尚未实施针对整个人群的流行病学研究。 方法--我们利用了2000年至2013年间居住在美国东南部的1300万医疗保险受益人的大约9400万份服务收费医疗保险记录的随访记录。 对于PM2.5的暴露，我们使用了空间和时间上的连续数据，这些数据改进了来自监测器的数据。 为了考虑PM2.5水平的时变，采用了带有Andersen-Gill计数过程的Cox模型。 按痴呆亚型和居住地城市化水平进行分层分析。 结果-在6年的中位随访中，有1,409,599人因痴呆住院。 调整后的痴呆住院危险比(HR)为每年PM2.5每增加1微克/立方米1.049（95%置信区间[CI]，1.048至1.051）。 尤其是血管性痴呆的危险比(HR，1.086；95%CI，1.082～1.090)较高。 影响的程度随着城市化水平的提高而增加（农村地区的人力资源为1.036；95%CI为1.031至1.041，而大都市地区的人力资源为1.052；95%CI为1.050至1.054）。 结论--长期暴露于较高的PM2.5与痴呆住院人数增加有关。 

  

###  Fine Particulate Matter and Poor Cognitive Function among Chinese Older Adults: Evidence from a Community-Based, 12-Year Prospective Cohort Study 2020

METHODS: This analysis included data on 13,324 older adults (5,879 who were 65–79 years of age, 3,052 who were 80–89 years of age, 2,634 who were 90–99 years of age, and 1,759 who were ≥100 years of age) with normal cognitive function at baseline from March 2002 to September 2014, with 64,648 person-years of follow-up. We used a geographic information system analysis to estimate the annual average satellite-derived PM2:5 concentration for the geocoded location of the participants’ baseline residences. Poor cognitive function was defined as a score of less than 18 on the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Competing risk models were performed to explore the association of PM2:5 with poor cognitive function. RESULTS: Each 10-lg=m3 increase in PM2:5 was associated with a 5.1% increased risk of poor cognitive function [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.051; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.023, 1.079]. Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2:5 (<41:4 lg=m3), adjusted HR values were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.41), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.34) for the second (≥41:4–50:3ug=m3), third (≥50:3–60:7lg=m3), and fourth (≥60:7 lg=m3) quartiles of PM2:5, respectively (p for trend <0:001). Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations between PM2:5 and poor cognitive impairment in men than women. The association was positive in the 65- to 79- and ≥100-y age group but not significant and positive in the other two age groups with similar results. CONCLUSION: PM2:5 was identified as a risk factor for poor cognitive function in Chinese older adults. Improving air quality may reduce the future population burden of poor cognitive function, especially in areas with high air pollution. 方法：2002年3月至2014年9月，对13324名认知功能正常的老年人（65～79岁5879人，80～89岁3052人，90～99岁2634人，≥100岁1759人）进行基线调查，随访64648人年。 我们使用地理信息系统分析来估计参与者基线住所地理编码位置的年平均卫星得出的PM2:5浓度。 认知功能差被定义为在MMSE中文版中低于18分。 采用竞争风险模型探讨PM2:5与认知功能差的关系。 结果:PM2:5每增加10-lg=m3与认知功能不良风险增加5.1%相关[调整危险比(HR):1.051；95%可信区间(CI):1.023,1.079]。 与PM2:5(<41:4 lg=m3)最低四分位数相比，第二个(≥41:4-50:3Ug=m3)、第三个(≥50:3-60:7lg=m3)和第四个(≥60:7lg=m3)四分位数的调整HR值分别为1.20(95%CI:1.09,1.33）,1.27(95%CI:1.15,1.41)和1.21(95%CI:1.09,1.34）（趋势P<0.001)。 亚组分析表明，男性中PM2:5与较差的认知障碍之间的联系比女性更强。 在65～79岁和≥100岁年龄组中，这种相关性呈阳性，但在其他两个相似的年龄组中，这种相关性不显著，呈阳性。 结论:PM2:5是老年人认知功能低下的危险因素。 改善空气质量可能会减轻未来认知功能不良的人口负担，尤其是在空气污染高的地区。 

  

###  Long-term effects of PM2·5 on neurological disorders in the American Medicare population: a longitudinal cohort study 2020

Background Accumulating evidence links fine particulate matter (PM2·5 ) to premature mortality, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. However, less is known about the influence of PM2·5 on neurological disorders. We aimed to investigate the effect of long-term PM2·5 exposure on development of Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Methods We did a longitudinal cohort study in which we constructed a population-based nationwide open cohort including all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (aged ≥65 years) in the contiguous United States (2000–16) with no exclusions. We assigned PM2·5 postal code (ie, ZIP code) concentrations based on mean annual predictions from a high-resolution model. To accommodate our very large dataset, we applied Cox-equivalent Poisson models with parallel computing to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for first hospital admission for Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, adjusting for potential confounders in the health models. Findings Between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2016, of 63 038 019 individuals who were aged 65 years or older during the study period, we identified 1·0 million cases of Parkinson’s disease and 3·4 million cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias based on primary and secondary diagnosis billing codes. For each 5 μg/m³ increase in annual PM2·5 concentrations, the HR was 1·13 (95% CI 1·12–1·14) for first hospital admission for Parkinson’s disease and 1·13 (1·12–1·14) for first hospital admission for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. For both outcomes, there was strong evidence of linearity at PM2·5 concentrations less than 16 μg/m³ (95th percentile of the PM2·5 distribution), followed by a plateaued association with increasingly larger confidence bands. Interpretation We provide evidence that exposure to annual mean PM2·5 in the USA is significantly associated with an increased hazard of first hospital admission with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. For the ageing American population, improving air quality to reduce PM2·5 concentrations to less than current national standards could yield substantial health benefits by reducing the burden of neurological disorders.

Globally, neurological disorders are the leading groupcause of disability and the second leading group-cause of death, posing an urgent and substantial worldwide public health challenge. Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. Worldwide, an estimated 6 million people have Parkinson’s disease and 44 million people have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 analysis estimated that, since 1990, the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease has increased by 145% and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have increased by 117%. The prevalence of these conditions is expected to continue to increase due to lengthening life expectancy. As no cure exists yet for these conditions, the identification of modifiable risk factors, such as environ­ mental exposures, should be a top research priority. 

  

Concern is mounting that air pollution increases the risk for neurological disorders. Emerging evidence has shown that particulate air pollution is associated with impaired cognitive function, accelerated cognitive decline, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia. Research suggests that air pollution might contribute to the potential onset of neurodegeneration via mecha­nisms such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and neuroinflammation, among others. There is also evidence that air pollution might exacerbate disease progression by accelerating these biological pathways or worsening intermediate processes. 

  

Therefore, the first hospital admission with a relevant diagnosis code is occurring sooner than expected. Previous studies that used hospital admission data to assess the effect of air pollution exposure on progression of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias included populations residing in the southeastern US region, the  Ontario province of Canada, and well monitored urban areas in the northeastern USA. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has been done in the whole US population. Previous studies also focused on older data; as air pollution concentrations have been steadily decreasing in the past few decades in the USA although increases have been seen in some regions, it is essential to establish whether these associations persist even at low concentrations. Hence, evidence remains scarce for the health effects of long-term exposure to low amounts of air pollution across the USA, including locations with sparse or no monitoring. 

  

We aimed to investigate the effect of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2·5 ) on hospital admissions with a Parkinson’s disease or an Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias diagnosis code. We leveraged a nation­ wide comprehensive dataset integrating highly accurate and well validated high-resolution PM2·5 prediction models and health data for all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries across the contiguous United States (2000–16). To address the computational chal­lenges, we applied a novel computationally scalable re-parameterised Cox-equivalent Poisson model. 

  

###  Fine Particulate Matter and Dementia Incidence in the Adult Changes in Thought Study 2021

BACKGROUND: Air pollution may be associated with elevated dementia risk. Prior research has limitations that may affect reliability, and no studies have evaluated this question in a population-based cohort of men and women in the United States. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association between time-varying, 10-y average fine particulate matter (PM2:5) exposure and hazard of all-cause dementia. An additional goal was to understand how to adequately control for age and calendar-time-related confounding through choice of the time axis and covariate adjustment. METHODS: Using the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) population-based prospective cohort study in Seattle, we linked spatiotemporal model-based PM2:5 exposures to participant addresses from 1978 to 2018. Dementia diagnoses were made using high-quality, standardized, consensus-based protocols at biennial follow-ups. We conducted multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the association between time-varying, 10-y average PM2:5 exposure and time to event in a model with age as the time axis, stratified by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and adjusted for sex, education, race, neighborhood median household income, and calendar time. Alternative models used calendar time as the time axis. RESULTS: We report 1,136 cases of incident dementia among 4,166 individuals with nonmissing APOE status. Mean [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] 10-y average PM2:5 was 10:1 ð ±2:9Þ lg=m3. Each 1-lg=m3 increase in the moving average of 10-y PM2:5 was associated with a 16% greater hazard of all-cause dementia [1.16 (95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.31)]. Results using calendar time as the time axis were similar. 背景：空气污染可能与痴呆风险升高有关。 先前的研究有可能影响可靠性的局限性，没有研究在美国基于人群的男性和女性队列中评估这个问题。 目的：我们评估时变，10-y平均细颗粒物(PM2:5)暴露与全因性痴呆危险之间的联系。 另一个目标是了解如何通过时间轴的选择和协变量调整来充分控制年龄和日历时间相关的混杂。 方法：利用西雅图成人思维改变(ACT)人群前瞻性队列研究，我们将1978年至2018年基于时空模型的PM2:5暴露与参与者地址联系起来。 痴呆诊断是在两年一次的随访中使用高质量、标准化、基于共识的协议进行的。 我们进行了多变量Cox比例风险回归，以年龄为时间轴，以载脂蛋白E(APOE)基因型分层，并调整了性别、教育程度、种族、社区家庭收入中位数和日历时间，以评估随时间变化的10-Y平均PM2:5暴露与事件发生时间之间的关系。 替代模型使用日历时间作为时间轴。 结果：我们报告了4166例非缺失ApoE状态的个体中的1136例偶发痴呆。 10Y平均PM2:5的平均值[平均标准差(SD)]为10:1±2:9~lg=m3。 10-y PM2:5移动平均值每增加1-lg=m3，全因性痴呆的危险就增加16%[1.16(95%可信区间:1.03，1.31)]。 以日历时间为时间轴的结果相似。 

  

###  Air pollution and neighborhood racial composition and their association with memory and memory decline inNHATS 2021

Background: Memory decline is a harbinger of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Air pollution was recently added as a dementia risk factor by the Lancet Commission, and area-level factors, such as neighborhood racial composition (a measure of structural racism) may modify the effects of air pollution. We examined the relationship between air pollution and neighborhood racial composition on memory and decline in a sample of older adults in the United States. Method:NHATS is a nationally-representative sample of 8,245 participants 65+years at baseline (2011). Annual averages of fine particulate matter (PM2.5,IQR=2.2 μg/m3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2,IQR = 5.5 ppb), and ozone (O3,IQR = 8.4 ppb) at baseline and Census ACS data were assigned to the Census tract of participants. The Index of Concentration at the Extremes, defined as: [(number in most disadvantaged extreme, i.e., Blacks) - (number in most privileged extreme, i.e., Whites)]/(total people) was calculated for each census tract as a measure of neighborhood racial composition. A composite measure of episodic memory was constructed as the average of z-scored delayed and immediate word list recall. We used linear mixed effects models to examine the association between each air pollutant and neighborhood racial composition with memory and memory decline over 6 years, adjusting for a number of individual(age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, smoker, practice effects) and area- (census division, urban tract) level covariates, with random effects for census tract and participant. Result: Increases in air pollution (per IQR) were weakly associated with worse memory at baseline [PM2.5 -0.02 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.006); NO2 -0.03 (-0.06, 0.002); O3 -0.03 (-0.06, -0.0004) SD-units in memory]. PM2.5 increased the rate of memory decline by 0.01 (-0.02, -0.0008);whileNO2 increased the rate of memorydecline by -0.008 (-0.01, -0.0007). Neighborhood racial composition was significantly associated with worse memory (for more disadvantaged neighborhoods) in all air pollution models, but it did not modify the effect of air pollution on memory nor memory decline. Conclusion: In this cohort of older adults, we found that PM2.5 and NO2 increase the rate of memory decline, while neighborhood racial composition does not modify this effect of air pollution. 背景：记忆力下降是阿尔茨海默病(AD)的先兆。 《柳叶刀》委员会最近增加了空气污染作为痴呆症风险因素，地区层面的因素，如社区种族组成（结构性种族主义的衡量标准）可能会改变空气污染的影响。 我们在美国的一个老年人样本中研究了空气污染和社区种族组成对记忆力和衰退的关系。 方法：NHATS是一个具有全国代表性的样本，共有8245名65岁以上的参与者（2011年）。 在基线和ACS普查数据中，细颗粒物(PM2.5、IQR=2.2微克/立方米）、二氧化氮(NO2、IQR=5.5 ppb）和臭氧(O3、IQR=8.4 ppb）的年平均值被分配给参与者的普查范围。 极端人口集中指数定义为:[（处境最不利的极端人口，即黑人）-（处境最有利的极端人口，即白人）]/（人口总数）是为每个人口普查区计算的，作为衡量邻里种族组成的标准。 情节记忆的综合测度被构建为Z评分的延迟和即时单词表回忆的平均值。 我们使用线性混合效应模型来检验每种空气污染物与6年来记忆和记忆下降的社区种族组成之间的联系，调整了一些个人（年龄、种族/民族、性别、教育、吸烟者、实践影响）和地区（人口普查分区、城市区域）水平的协变量，以及人口普查区域和参与者的随机效应。 结果：空气污染的增加（每IQR）与记忆差在基线[PM2.5-0.02(95%CI:-0.05，0.006)；NO2-0.03(-0.06，0.002)；O3-0.03(-0.06，-0.0004)SD-记忆单位]之间的相关性较弱。 PM2.5使记忆下降率增加0.01（-0.02,-0.0008）；而O2使记忆下降率增加-0.008（-0.01,-0.0007）。 在所有的空气污染模型中，社区的种族组成与更差的记忆（对于更弱势的社区）显著相关，但它没有改变空气污染对记忆或记忆衰退的影响。 结论：在老年人群中，我们发现PM2.5和NO2增加了记忆力下降的速度，而邻居的种族组成并没有改变空气污染的这种影响。**
### Particulate matter and Alzheimer’s disease: an intimate connection 2022
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/WTC/Particulate%20matter%20and%20Alzheimer’s%20disease%20an%20intimate%20connection.pdf)
Worldwide, individuals are routinely exposed to levels of particulate matter (PM) above the air quality guideline levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO), placing them at risk for developing PM-induced diseases.

PM enters the body and affects the progression of numerous diseases, many of which impact vital organs such as the heart, lungs, brain, and gut.

PM may infiltrate the brain and engender the development of numerous cognitive diseases by crossing the blood–brain barrier or traveling through the olfactory bulb.

PM exposure and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) development are strongly correlated and PM is believed to exacerbate AD development via a complex interplay of mechanisms.

Treatments for AD remain limited, but a deeper understanding of the risk factors and AD pathogenesis will enable researchers to design studies aimed to mitigate AD symptoms and development.

在世界范围内，个人经常暴露于高于世界卫生组织 (WHO) 制定的空气质量指导水平的颗粒物 (PM) 水平，使他们面临患 PM 诱发疾病的风险。PM 进入人体并影响多种疾病的进展，其中许多会影响心脏、肺、大脑和肠道等重要器官。PM 可能通过穿过血脑屏障或穿过嗅球渗入大脑并导致多种认知疾病的发展。PM 暴露与阿尔茨海默病 (AD) 发展密切相关，并且 PM 被认为通过复杂的机制相互作用加剧 AD 发展。AD 的治疗仍然有限，但对风险因素和 AD 发病机制的更深入了解将使研究人员能够设计旨在减轻 AD 症状和发展的研究。

  

The environmental role in disease progression has been appreciated for decades; however, understanding how airborne toxicant exposure can affect organs beyond the lungs is an underappreciated area of scientific inquiry. Particulate matter (PM) includes various gases, liquids, and particles in suspension and is produced by industrial activities such as fossil fuel combustion and natural events including wildfires and volcanic eruptions. Although agencies have attempted to reduce acceptable airborne particulate levels, with urbanization and population growth, these policies have been only moderately effective in mitigating disease progression. A growing area of research is focused on the role of PM exposure in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This review will summarize the knowns and unknowns of this expanding field.几十年来，环境在疾病进展中的作用一直受到重视。 然而，了解空气中的毒物暴露如何影响肺部以外的器官是一个未被充分认识的科学探究领域。 颗粒物 (PM) 包括各种气体、液体和悬浮颗粒，由化石燃料燃烧等工业活动和包括野火和火山爆发在内的自然事件产生。 尽管随着城市化和人口增长，各机构已尝试降低可接受的空气中颗粒物水平，但这些政策在减缓疾病进展方面仅具有中等效果。 越来越多的研究领域集中在 PM 暴露在阿尔茨海默病 (AD) 进展中的作用。 这篇综述将总结这个不断扩大的领域的已知和未知。

  

PM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of solid and liquid particles suspended in the air (Box 1) [1.]. Current research has established compelling relationships between PM exposure and the development of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and lung diseases, including aggravated asthma [1.,2.]. These connections are alarming due to the significant number of individuals routinely exposed to dangerous PM levels worldwide. Importantly, recent studies have also established connections between PM exposure and neurological diseases such as AD [3.]. PM 由悬浮在空气中的固体和液体颗粒的不均匀混合物组成（方框 1）[1.]。 目前的研究已经在 PM 暴露与缺血性心脏病、心肌梗塞和肺部疾病（包括哮喘加重）的发展之间建立了令人信服的关系。 由于全球有大量个人经常暴露于危险的 PM 水平，这些联系令人担忧。 重要的是，最近的研究还建立了 PM 暴露与 AD 等神经系统疾病之间的联系。

  

What is PM?

PM is a heterogeneous mixture of particles derived from numerous anthropogenic and natural sources. These particles are classified by diameter as ultrafine (PM0.1, <0.1 μm), fine (PM2.5, <0.25 μm), and coarse (PM10, <10 μm). PM is generated by industrial activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, household activities, such as cooking or cleaning, and transportation, construction, and agriculture (Figure I). Particulates have been shown to enter the body through the lungs, gut, olfactory bulb, and various other points (see Figure I, Key figure in Box 3). Infiltration of PM into the body can cause a localized or systemic response, potentially affecting multiple organ systems following exposure. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that millions of deaths and over a hundred million years of healthy life are lost to air pollution exposure each year, ranking air pollution as a top ten risk factor for mortality worldwide.

In 2017, 92% of the world’s population resided in areas with PM2.5 levels above the WHO annual mean Air Quality Guideline (AQG) of 10 μg/m3; the annual mean AQG for PM2.5 was reduced further to 5 μg/m3 in 2021 [50.,51.]. PM exposure has been linked to respiratory, cardiovascular, and cognitive disease development as well as systemic inflammation. Furthermore, PM has been shown to directly cause neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in an in vitro cell model, but the effects are dependent on particulate size, seasonality of particles, and chemical composition [52., 53., 54.].

Epidemiological data have shown that PM levels were significantly reduced during the latest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, predominantly due to stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of businesses, work, etc. The WHO recently declared PM as a top ten health hazard and its association with other main diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, are alarming [55.]. Although exposure to ambient/outdoor PM is assumed to be the main culprit of disease risk, the risk of indoor PM contributing to disease cannot be forgotten.

PM 是来自众多人为和天然来源的颗粒的异质混合物。这些颗粒按直径分为超细（PM0.1，<0.1 μm）、细（PM2.5，<0.25 μm）和粗（PM10，<10 μm）。 PM 由工业活动（如化石燃料燃烧）、家庭活动（如烹饪或清洁）以及交通、建筑和农业产生（图 I）。已显示颗粒物通过肺、肠道、嗅球和其他各个部位进入人体（见图 I，方框 3 中的关键图）。 PM 渗入体内可引起局部或全身反应，暴露后可能影响多个器官系统。 2021 年，世界卫生组织 (WHO) 表示，每年有数百万人因暴露于空气污染中而丧生和超过一亿年的健康生命，将空气污染列为全球十大死亡风险因素 [50.,51 .]。

2017 年，全球 92% 的人口居住在 PM2.5 水平高于世卫组织年度平均空气质量指南 (AQG) 10 μg/m3 的地区； 2021 年 PM2.5 的年平均 AQG 进一步降低至 5 μg/m3 [50.,51.]。 PM 暴露与呼吸、心血管和认知疾病的发展以及全身炎症有关。此外，在体外细胞模型中，PM 已被证明直接引起神经毒性和氧化应激，但其影响取决于颗粒大小、颗粒的季节性和化学成分 [52., 53., 54.]。

流行病学数据显示，在最新的 2019 年冠状病毒病 (COVID-19) 大流行期间，PM 水平显着降低，主要是由于居家令和企业、工作等关闭。世界卫生组织最近宣布 PM 为前十名健康危害及其与其他主要疾病（包括心血管疾病和癌症）的关联令人担忧 [55.]。尽管暴露于环境/室外 PM 被认为是疾病风险的主要原因，但不能忘记室内 PM 导致疾病的风险。

The common sources of human-derived PM are transportation, construction, agricultural, industrial, and household pollutants. Agricultural sources of PM result from spraying crops with pesticides and fertilizers, combusting fossil fuels to power equipment, and aerosolizing dust during the movement of equipment and harvesting of crops. Industrial sources of PM originate mainly from the emissions of combusted fuels used to power manufacturing processes. Household sources of PM predominately affect the composition of interior air and are mainly derived from activities like cooking, using cleaning products, burning candles and fires, and smoking. Construction introduces various types of PM into the atmosphere through activities such as grinding and resurfacing roads, grinding metals, welding, cutting materials, excavating, moving materials, and emitting combustion fumes from construction equipment. Lastly, transportation sources of PM derive from brake dust, train and subway wheelsets interacting with rails, tires and pavement interacting, and fuel combustion associated with powering the transporters.人源 PM 的常见来源是交通、建筑、农业、工业和家庭污染物。 PM 的农业来源来自向农作物喷洒杀虫剂和化肥、燃烧化石燃料为动力设备以及在设备移动和农作物收割过程中雾化粉尘。 PM 的工业来源主要来自用于为制造过程提供动力的燃烧燃料的排放。 PM 的家庭来源主要影响室内空气的组成，主要来自烹饪、使用清洁产品、燃烧蜡烛和火以及吸烟等活动。建筑通过诸如研磨和重铺道路、研磨金属、焊接、切割材料、挖掘、移动材料以及从建筑设备排放燃烧烟雾等活动将各种类型的 PM 引入大气。最后，PM 的运输来源来自制动粉尘、火车和地铁轮对与铁轨相互作用、轮胎和路面相互作用，以及与为运输工具提供动力相关的燃料燃烧。

  

AD is a neurodegenerative (see Glossary) disorder that typically presents in individuals over 65 years old, has a wide variety of symptoms, and is the most common form of dementia [4., 5., 6., 7.] (Box 2). Recent studies have found positive correlations between PM exposure and dementia incidence in human cohorts after adjusting for community- and individual-level social and economic characteristics [8., 9., 10.]. Furthermore, mouse models exposed to PM displayed elevated AD biomarkers compared with filtered air (FA) controls [10.]. Studies have also shown PM exacerbates the aggregation and deposition of the AD hallmarks amyloid beta plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain through mechanisms related to microglia/astrocyte activation, oxidative stress, immune activation, and neuroinflammation [3.,10., 11., 12., 13.]. This review presents evidence of neurologic changes induced by PM, with an emphasis on the mechanisms associated with AD pathogenesis.AD 是一种神经退行性疾病（见术语表），通常出现在 65 岁以上的个体中，具有多种症状，是最常见的痴呆形式 [4., 5., 6., 7.]（框 2 ）。 最近的研究发现，在调整了社区和个人层面的社会和经济特征后，PM 暴露与人类群体中的痴呆症发病率之间存在正相关 [8., 9., 10.]。 此外，与过滤空气 (FA) 对照相比，暴露于 PM 的小鼠模型显示出升高的 AD 生物标志物 [10.]。 研究还表明，PM 通过与小胶质细胞/星形胶质细胞激活、氧化应激、免疫激活和神经炎症相关的机制，加剧大脑中 AD 标志性淀粉样蛋白斑块 (Aβ) 和神经原纤维缠结 (NFT) 的聚集和沉积 [3., 10.、11.、12.、13.]。 这篇综述提供了 PM 引起的神经系统变化的证据，重点是与 AD 发病机制相关的机制。

  

AD explained

AD, a progressive, neurodegenerative disease, accounts for 50–75% of all dementia cases [7.]. In 2021, approximately 6.2 million Americans aged 65+ years lived with AD, while 55 million individuals globally lived with AD and other dementias; cases are expected to increase threefold by 2050 [56., 57., 58.]. Symptoms of AD include reduced mental processing, working memory, creativity, mobility, attention, problem-solving, memory recall efficiency, odor identification, and language skills, and altered mood and sleep patterns [4.,5.]. Symptom severity ranges from mild to severe impairment, where daily living assistance is required. Unfortunately, a cure for AD does not exist; death due to AD and its associated complications is imminent and typically occurs 8–10 years after diagnosis [7.,59.].

The two main forms of AD are late-onset AD (LOAD), occurring after age 65, and early-onset AD (EOAD), occurring prior to age 65 [60.]. LOAD accounts for 90–95% of cases and typically has sporadic origins (i.e., nongenetic etiologies) [61.,62.]. EOAD accounts for the remaining 5–10% of cases and is commonly considered familial EOAD due to its heritability and established genetic mutations [61.]. Of all EOAD patients, 35–60% have a first-degree relative suffering from AD. Mutations in the genes coding for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 are established causes of EOAD [63.]. Meanwhile, LOAD develops from an amalgam of environmental and external risk factors [64.]. Approximately two-thirds of all AD patients are female, leading researchers to believe that sex-driven developmental and physiological differences contribute to AD development [65.]. Nongenetic risk factors associated with AD include, but are not limited to, high systolic blood pressure during midlife, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and environmental exposures, such as PM [4.,66., 67., 68.].

AD is primarily diagnosed through psychiatric evaluations and memory and cognitive assessments as symptoms become more clinically apparent, though amyloid PET imaging may also be utilized [6.,7.]. Amyloid PET imaging detects the presence of β-amyloid in the brain antemortem and is available for clinical use, but low reimbursement rates currently minimize the accessibility of this diagnostic tool [69.].

AD treatments remain limited due to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms driving Aβ and NFT formation. Current treatments focus on symptom alleviation, as therapeutics designed to slow or reverse AD progression are in the infancy stages of development. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to treat AD symptoms and memantine is another acceptable option for symptom relief [69.].

AD 是一种进行性神经退行性疾病，占所有痴呆病例的 50-75% [7.]。 2021 年，大约 620 万 65 岁以上的美国人患有 AD，而全球有 5500 万人患有 AD 和其他痴呆症；到 2050 年，病例预计将增加三倍 [56., 57., 58.]。 AD 的症状包括降低心理处理、工作记忆、创造力、流动性、注意力、解决问题的能力、记忆回忆效率、气味识别和语言技能，以及改变情绪和睡眠模式 [4.,5.]。症状严重程度从轻度到重度损伤不等，需要日常生活协助。不幸的是，没有治愈 AD 的方法。由于 AD 及其相关并发症导致的死亡迫在眉睫，通常发生在诊断后 8-10 年 [7.,59.]。

AD 的两种主要形式是晚发性 AD (LOAD)，发生在 65 岁之后，以及早发性 AD (EOAD)，发生在 65 岁之前 [60.]。 LOAD 占病例的 90-95%，通常具有散发性起源（即非遗传病因）[61.,62.]。 EOAD 占其余病例的 5-10%，由于其遗传性和确定的基因突变，通常被认为是家族性 EOAD [61.]。在所有 EOAD 患者中，35-60% 的一级亲属患有 AD。编码淀粉样前体蛋白 (APP)、早老素 1 和早老素 2 的基因突变是 EOAD 的确定原因 [63.]。同时，负载是由环境和外部风险因素的混合物发展而来的 [64.]。大约三分之二的 AD 患者是女性，这使研究人员认为，性别驱动的发育和生理差异有助于 AD 的发展 [65.]。与 AD 相关的非遗传风险因素包括但不限于中年期高收缩压、2 型糖尿病、肥胖和环境暴露，例如 PM [4.,66., 67., 68.]。

AD 主要通过精神病学评估以及记忆和认知评估来诊断，因为症状在临床上变得更加明显，但也可以使用淀粉样蛋白 PET 成像 [6.,7.]。淀粉样蛋白 PET 成像可检测死前大脑中 β-淀粉样蛋白的存在，并可用于临床，但目前低报销率最大限度地减少了这种诊断工具的可及性 [69.]。

由于对驱动 Aβ 和 NFT 形成的机制的理解不完全，AD 治疗仍然有限。目前的治疗侧重于缓解症状，因为旨在减缓或逆转 AD 进展的治疗正处于发展的初期阶段。乙酰胆碱酯酶抑制剂通常用于治疗 AD 症状，美金刚是缓解症状的另一种可接受的选择 [69.]。

  

PM effects on the brain

Environmental exposures, including PM, are thought to contribute to AD development and progression. Hallmarks of AD amplified by PM, such as Aβ deposition, NFT accumulation, and cognitive impairments, may manifest well before AD clinical diagnosis [14.,15.]. In addition to these disease characteristics, many other alterations that potentiate AD (i.e., microglial activation, systemic/neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, immune activation, and behavioral changes) have been found in PM-exposed animals [3.,16., 17., 18., 19., 20.]. The following section will discuss clinical hallmarks of AD and associated changes in the context of PM exposure through clinical and preclinical studies to better understand PM exposures and AD development. 包括 PM 在内的环境暴露被认为有助于 AD 的发展和进展。 PM 放大的 AD 特征，例如 Aβ 沉积、NFT 积累和认知障碍，可能在 AD 临床诊断之前就已经显现 [14.,15.]。 除了这些疾病特征外，在 PM 暴露的动物中还发现了许多其他增强 AD 的改变（即小胶质细胞激活、全身/神经炎症、氧化应激、免疫激活和行为改变）[3.,16., 17。 , 18., 19., 20.]。 以下部分将通过临床和临床前研究讨论 AD 的临床特征以及 PM 暴露背景下的相关变化，以更好地了解 PM 暴露和 AD 发展。

  

PM-associated AD markers in human subjects

Urban and rural locations experience varied levels of PM2.5 that periodically exceed quality recommendations, but areas, including Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), face lifetime PM2.5 exposures chronically higher than annual guidelines [21.]. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was validated in a study comparing MoCA with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection sensitivity rate of 90% compared with the MMSE rate of 18%; thus, the MoCA is considered a reliable screening tool for MCI by addressing several cognitive domains and offering insight into whether individuals require additional cognitive assessment/attention [21.,22.]. The MoCA was implemented in a study of young middle socioeconomic class urbanites (21.6 ± 5.8 years old) living in MCMA, Hermosillo (HER), and several other PM2.5-polluted cities exceeding US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) annual standards of 12 μg/m3 to quantify individuals who performed abnormally on the assessment based on PM2.5 levels [21.]. Findings revealed 55% of participants scored within the MCI score range, 30.3% of which were considered AD scores [21.]. HER, with the lowest PM2.5 concentrations above USEPA standards, was a control city; MCMA was a megacity (~2.5× higher PM2.5 levels than USEPA standards); and all cities except the control were combined into a group (OTHERS) for comparison purposes [21.]. MoCA scores were considered statistically equivalent across residencies; however, when considering specific tasks and tests, differences between HER, MCMA, and OTHERS became apparent in cube drawing, language fluency task, abstraction, and orientation, pointing to a stratification in cognitive ability based on PM2.5 exposure levels [21.]. The cognitive domain index scores specifically showed participants with scores within the MCI range experienced significantly reduced executive, language, visuospatial, and composite delay memory [21.]. Here, just 20 years of PM2.5 exposure above air quality standards appears to propel over half of the participants into the prodromal stage of AD, approximately 40 years earlier than symptoms are typically distinguishable in AD patients. 人类受试者中 PM 相关的 AD 标志物

城市和农村地区的 PM2.5 水平不一，定期超过质量建议，但包括墨西哥城都会区 (MCMA) 在内的地区，终生 PM2.5 暴露量长期高于年度指南 [21.]。蒙特利尔认知评估（MoCA）在一项比较 MoCA 与简易精神状态检查（MMSE）的研究中得到验证，轻度认知障碍（MCI）检测灵敏度为 90%，而 MMSE 为 18%；因此，MoCA 被认为是 MCI 的可靠筛查工具，它通过解决多个认知领域并提供洞察个人是否需要额外的认知评估/注意 [21.,22.]。 MoCA 是在对居住在 MCMA、埃莫西约 (HER) 和其他几个 PM2.5 污染超过美国环境保护署 (USEPA) 年度标准 12 μg/m3 以根据 PM2.5 水平量化在评估中表现异常的个人 [21.]。调查结果显示，55% 的参与者得分在 MCI 得分范围内，其中 30.3% 被认为是 AD 得分 [21.]。 HER 的 PM2.5 浓度最低，高于 USEPA 标准，是控制城市； MCMA 是一个特大城市（PM2.5 水平比 USEPA 标准高约 2.5 倍）；并将除对照之外的所有城市组合成一个组（其他）以进行比较[21.]。 MoCA 分数在住院医师间被认为具有统计学意义；然而，在考虑具体的任务和测试时，HER、MCMA 和 OTHERS 之间的差异在立方体绘图、语言流畅性任务、抽象和定向方面变得明显，表明基于 PM2.5 暴露水平的认知能力分层[21.] .认知领域指数得分特别表明，得分在 MCI 范围内的参与者的执行力、语言、视觉空间和复合延迟记忆显着降低 [21.]。在这里，仅仅 20 年的 PM2.5 暴露于空气质量标准之上，似乎将超过一半的参与者推入 AD 的前驱阶段，比 AD 患者通常可以区分的症状早了大约 40 年。

  

A cross-sectional study of older adults (mean age of 75.8 years) suffering from cognitive impairment living in areas with air quality values ranging from 4.01 μg/m3 to 22.84 μg/m3 was conducted to determine whether air quality levels impact the likelihood of receiving a positive amyloid positron emission tomography (amyloid PET) scan, indicating the presence of neuronal Aβ [23.]. Data from 18 178 individuals who experienced MCI (60.5%) or dementia (39.5%) from the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning Study were used [23.]. Those living in areas with higher PM2.5 concentrations had a greater likelihood of a positive amyloid PET scan result when factors including demographics, lifestyle, socioeconomics, and comorbidities were considered [23.]. A similar study examined the association between AD hallmarks and PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5abs, a marker of black/elemental carbon, in cognitively unimpaired 57-year-old Barcelona residents from the ALFA study (Alzheimer and Families) [24.]. AD hallmarks were measured by determining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker concentrations [Aβ42, Aβ40, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), and cerebral amyloid load (centiloid)] and Aβ deposition [24.]. Family history and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status were considered and land use regression models were implemented to estimate PM exposures for individuals based on residential addresses [24.]. Positive associations were found between both PM2.5 and PM10 and CSF NfL levels. Upon adjusting for APOE-ε4 status, associations remained between individuals who were CSF Aβ-positive and PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5abs and centiloid values, a scale used to compare neuronal Aβ deposits across positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracers [24.,25.]. APOE-ε4 status did not alter associations, though a stronger effect of PM exposure on CSF NfL was found among carriers [24.]. The APOE status of individuals must be considered when conducting research on AD and PM, as studies have found different rates of accelerated global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia based on APOE genotypes and 3-year average PM2.5 exposures. When individuals aged 65–79 years with the APOE-ε4 genotype resided in PM2.5 locations exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards, rates of cognitive decline and all-cause dementia were amplified [26.]. Furthermore, a study by Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. has found increased p-tau and Aβ diffuse plaque levels in children and young adults exposed to PM2.5 and ozone concentrations exceeding USEPA standards in MCMA [27.]. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised was implemented and found MCMA children possessing the APOE-ε4 genotype performed significantly worse in arithmetic, information, picture completion, and digit span tests, indicating differences in short and working memory performance compared with noncarrier APOE-ε3 subjects [27.]. These studies point to a reduction in cognitive performance and AD potentiation based on genotype and lifetime PM2.5 exposures exceeding US national guidelines. The changes in memory performance found among children demonstrate early consequences associated with PM and point to a compounding effect of PM exposures over time that may culminate in the development of AD. 对居住在空气质量值介于 4.01 μg/m3 至 22.84 μg/m3 之间的地区患有认知障碍的老年人（平均年龄 75.8 岁）进行了一项横断面研究，以确定空气质量水平是否会影响接受阳性淀粉样蛋白正电子发射断层扫描（淀粉样蛋白 PET）扫描，表明存在神经元 Aβ [23.]。使用了来自淀粉样蛋白扫描研究影像痴呆症证据的 18178 名患有 MCI (60.5%) 或痴呆症 (39.5%) 的个体的数据 [23.]。当考虑人口统计、生活方式、社会经济学和合并症等因素时，居住在 PM2.5 浓度较高地区的人更有可能获得淀粉样蛋白 PET 扫描结果呈阳性 [23.]。一项类似的研究在来自 ALFA 研究（阿尔茨海默氏症和家庭）的认知未受损的 57 岁巴塞罗那居民中检查了 AD 标志与 PM2.5、PM10 和 PM2.5abs（黑色/元素碳的标志物）之间的关联 [24 .]。通过确定脑脊液 (CSF) 生物标志物浓度 [Aβ42、Aβ40、过度磷酸化 tau (p-tau)、总 tau (t-tau)、神经丝光 (NfL) 和脑淀粉样蛋白负荷 (centiloid)] 和 Aβ 来测量 AD 标志物沉积[24.]。考虑了家族史和载脂蛋白 E (APOE) ε4 状态，并实施了土地利用回归模型，以根据居住地址估计个人的 PM 暴露 [24.]。 PM2.5 和 PM10 与 CSF NfL 水平之间存在正相关。在调整 APOE-ε4 状态后，CSF Aβ 阳性个体与 PM2.5、PM10 和 PM2.5abs 和 centiloid 值之间仍然存在关联，该量表用于比较正电子发射断层扫描 (PET) 成像示踪剂中的神经元 Aβ 沉积物[24.,25.]。 APOE-ε4 状态并没有改变关联，尽管在携带者中发现 PM 暴露对 CSF NfL 的影响更强[24.]。在对 AD 和 PM 进行研究时，必须考虑个人的 APOE 状态，因为研究发现，基于 APOE 基因型和 3 年平均 PM2.5 暴露量，全球认知能力加速下降和全因痴呆的速度不同。当 65-79 岁的 APOE-ε4 基因型个体居住在 PM2.5 超过国家环境空气质量标准的地点时，认知能力下降和全因痴呆的发生率被放大 [26.]。此外，Calderón-Garcidueñas 等人的一项研究。发现暴露于 PM2.5 和臭氧浓度的儿童和年轻人中 p-tau 和 Aβ 弥漫性斑块水平增加，超过了 MCMA 中的 USEPA 标准 [27.]。实施了韦氏儿童智力量表修订版，发现拥有 APOE-ε4 基因型的 MCMA 儿童在算术、信息、图片完成和数字跨度测试中表现明显较差，表明与非携带者 APOE-ε3 相比，短记忆和工作记忆表现存在差异科目 [27.]。这些研究表明，基于基因型和终生 PM2.5 暴露量超过美国国家指南，认知能力和 AD 增强会降低。在儿童中发现的记忆能力变化表明了与 PM 相关的早期后果，并指出随着时间的推移 PM 暴露的复合效应可能最终导致 AD 的发展。

  

Further evidence of long-term PM10 exposure on AD pathology was found by studying a population of cognitively normal and MCI older adults aged 65+ years from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD via clinical assessments, PET scans, MRIs, and mean concentration of PM10 from the past 5 years (PM10mean) matching with participants’ residences [28.]. Individuals exposed to the highest tertile of PM10mean (48.0–67.0 μg/m3) experienced a greater Aβ positivity risk assessed via PET scan after controlling for confounding variables, but no significant association was found between tau accumulation nor AD-signature cortical thickness and PM exposure [28.]. The human studies described suggest greater incidence of eventual AD diagnosis across locations and populations exposed to higher PM levels. These data should serve as an alarm for public health experts to examine healthy air quality levels and strategies to minimize air particulate levels to prevent lifetime exposures exceeding quality guidelines and mitigating disease [23.,24.,28.]. Furthermore, these data point to the need to study animal and in vitro models to gain an increased understanding of the mechanisms driving AD development in the context of PM exposure. 通过临床评估、PET 扫描、MRI 研究韩国脑衰老研究早期诊断和预测 AD 的认知正常和 MCI 老年人群，发现了长期 PM10 暴露对 AD 病理学的进一步证据和过去 5 年的 PM10 平均浓度 (PM10mean) 与参与者的住所相匹配 [28.]。在控制混杂变量后，暴露于最高三分位数 PM10mean (48.0–67.0 μg/m3) 的个体经历了更大的 Aβ 阳性风险，通过 PET 扫描评估，但未发现 tau 积累或 AD 特征皮层厚度与 PM 暴露之间存在显着关联[28.]。所描述的人类研究表明，在暴露于较高 PM 水平的地点和人群中，最终 AD 诊断的发生率更高。这些数据应作为公共卫生专家的警报，以检查健康的空气质量水平和策略，以尽量减少空气颗粒水平，以防止终生暴露超过质量指南并减轻疾病 [23.,24.,28.]。此外，这些数据表明需要研究动物和体外模型，以加深对 PM 暴露背景下驱动 AD 发展的机制的理解。

  

PM-associated AD markers in animal models and beyond

  

Behavioral response

  

Several animal studies offer insight into PM-induced behavioral changes in transgenic AD animal models. Memory and behavioral alterations were found after exposing 12.5–14-month male 3xTgAD and noncarrier control animals to PM0.1 (~58 μg/m3) or FA (4 h/day, 4 days/week) for 2 weeks; reduced spatial learning and impaired short-term memory were found in PM-exposed animals, independent of genotype [19.]. Differences in depressive- and anxiety-like responses in C57BL/6 male mice exposed to PM2.5 (16.85 μg/m3) versus FA over a 10-month (6 h/day, 5 days/week) period have also been detected [29.]. Further, reduced spatial learning and memory in PM2.5-exposed animals compared with FA-exposed controls of the same C57BL/6 genotype were found [29.]. These findings are especially important, as the animals exposed to PM2.5 were nontransgenic and thus possessed no predisposition to AD symptomology, similar to most individuals diagnosed with AD. Additionally, the PM2.5 exposure concentrations are environmentally relevant to levels experienced by individuals living in metropolitan areas. Motor coordination deficits have been found in 5xFAD mice exposed to diesel engine exhaust for 13 weeks with a 0.95 mg/m3 dose (6 h/day, 5 days/week) compared with FA-exposed controls regardless of indistinguishable Aβ plaque loads between exposures [30.]. Exposing 6-month-old 3xTgAD mice to PM2.5 at a mean concentration of 11.38 μg/m3 for 3 months failed to elicit spatial learning/memory and motor activity differences [31.]. The failure of this PM2.5 exposure to elicit changes associated with clinical presentation of disease while promoting differences in p-tau and oxidative stress levels serves as an important reminder that hallmarks develop far before clinical diagnoses [31.]. While findings vary in terms of the age at which behavioral changes present based on PM2.5 concentrations, exposure duration, and genotype, spatial learning and memory and motor coordination challenges are signs consistently found among PM-exposed animals, aligning with the clinical presentation of AD (Box 2) [19.,29., 30., 31.].

几项动物研究提供了对转基因 AD 动物模型中 PM 诱导的行为变化的深入了解。将 12.5-14 个月的雄性 3xTgAD 和非携带者对照动物暴露于 PM0.1（~58 μg/m3）或 FA（4 小时/天，4 天/周）2 周后发现记忆和行为改变；在暴露于 PM 的动物中发现空间学习减少和短期记忆受损，与基因型无关 [19.]。还检测到暴露于 PM2.5 (16.85 μg/m3) 与 FA 的 C57BL/6 雄性小鼠在 10 个月（6 小时/天，5 天/周）期间的抑郁和焦虑样反应的差异。 29.]。此外，发现与相同 C57BL/6 基因型的 FA 暴露对照相比，PM2.5 暴露动物的空间学习和记忆能力降低 [29.]。这些发现尤其重要，因为暴露于 PM2.5 的动物是非转基因的，因此与大多数被诊断患有 AD 的个体相似，它们不具有 AD 症状的易感性。此外，PM2.5 暴露浓度与居住在大都市地区的个人所经历的水平相关。与暴露于 FA 的对照组相比，暴露于柴油发动机排气 13 周的 5xFAD 小鼠发现运动协调缺陷，而暴露之间的 Aβ 斑块负荷无法区分。 30.]。将 6 个月大的 3xTgAD 小鼠暴露于平均浓度为 11.38 μg/m3 的 PM2.5 中 3 个月未能引起空间学习/记忆和运动活动差异 [31.]。这种 PM2.5 暴露未能引发与疾病临床表现相关的变化，同时促进 p-tau 和氧化应激水平的差异，这是一个重要的提醒，即标志在临床诊断之前就已经形成 [31.]。虽然根据 PM2.5 浓度、暴露持续时间和基因型而出现行为变化的年龄有所不同，但在暴露于 PM2.5 的动物中始终发现空间学习和记忆以及运动协调挑战的迹象，与临床表现一致AD（方框 2）[19.,29., 30., 31.]。

  

Systemic response

  

Aβ plaques are considered hallmark characteristics of AD brains, but these markers do not act independently. Convincing evidence that a compensatory response occurs in the brain to maintain homeostasis is supported by microglial activation, which is often found in conjunction with Aβ plaques [32.]. Microglia are activated and act protectively when the brain undergoes stress or injury [33.]. Early activation allows for phagocytosis and antigen presentation; however, prolonged activation can have consequences, including enhanced neuroinflammation. In AD, microglia appear to fail to clear Aβ and return to a resting state, though it is also possible their presence may perpetuate Aβ accumulation [32.]. Regardless, both scenarios result in an abundance of inflammatory mediators and neuronal damage [33.].

Exposing aged male 3xTgAD mice and noncarrier counterparts to PM0.1 or FA elicited significantly higher levels of total microglia in 3xTgAD mice than noncarrier counterparts, offering support for the complex nature of microglial activation and response in AD [16.]. PM0.1 exposure significantly lowered overall microglia present in both 3xTgAD animals and noncarrier counterparts, as determined by ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and Sholl analysis [16.]. Still, transgenic mice exposed to PM0.1 experienced significantly more microglia per plaque (9.3 microglia/plaque) compared with air-exposed controls (4.7 microglia/plaque) [16.]. Another study further exemplifies the nuances between microglial activation and AD as sex-dependent differences in microglial responses were found based on air exposure [34.]. After continuously exposing male and female transgenic (TgF344-AD) rats and noncarrier control littermates to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) (15.6 ± 3.7 μg/m3), microglial activation differences were assessed by co-labeling brain sections with Iba1 and CD68, a marker of phagocytic microglia [34.]. Among female rats, TRAP exposure increased microglial activation in both genotypes by 3 months and in TgF344-AD at 6 months of age; however, microglial activation was reduced in both genotypes of TRAP-exposed 15-month-old animals (14-month exposure) [34.]. Male TRAP-exposed rats experienced heightened microglial activation at 6 months of age, no change at 10 months, and greater activation among both genotypes at 15 months [34.]. These findings demonstrate the complexity associated with microglial responses and AD; microglia can contribute as early responders to clear Aβ plaques, though as the plaques persist, their existence and ability to recruit additional inflammatory mediators may further contribute to plaque deposition [16.,32.,34.].

Aβ 斑块被认为是 AD 大脑的标志性特征，但这些标志物并不独立发挥作用。令人信服的证据表明，大脑中发生了维持体内平衡的代偿性反应，这得到了小胶质细胞激活的支持，小胶质细胞激活通常与 Aβ 斑块一起发现 [32.]。当大脑承受压力或损伤时，小胶质细胞会被激活并发挥保护作用 [33.]。早期激活允许吞噬作用和抗原呈递；然而，长时间的激活可能会产生后果，包括增强神经炎症。在 AD 中，小胶质细胞似乎无法清除 Aβ 并恢复到静息状态，尽管它们的存在也有可能使 Aβ 积累永久化 [32.]。无论如何，这两种情况都会导致大量炎症介质和神经元损伤 [33.]。

将老年雄性 3xTgAD 小鼠和非携带者小鼠暴露于 PM0.1 或 FA 后，3xTgAD 小鼠的总小胶质细胞水平显着高于非携带者小鼠，这为 AD 中小胶质细胞激活和反应的复杂性提供了支持 [16.]。 PM0.1 暴露显着降低了 3xTgAD 动物和非载体对应物中存在的整体小胶质细胞，这由离子化的钙结合衔接分子 1 (Iba1) 和 Sholl 分析确定 [16.]。尽管如此，与暴露于空气的对照（4.7 个小胶质细胞/斑块）相比，暴露于 PM0.1 的转基因小鼠每个斑块（9.3 个小胶质细胞/斑块）经历了显着更多的小胶质细胞 [16.]。另一项研究进一步举例说明了小胶质细胞激活和 AD 之间的细微差别，因为基于空气暴露发现了小胶质细胞反应的性别依赖性差异 [34.]。在将雄性和雌性转基因 (TgF344-AD) 大鼠和非携带者对照同窝仔鼠连续暴露于交通相关空气污染 (TRAP) (15.6 ± 3.7 μg/m3) 后，通过用 Iba1 和 CD68 共同标记脑切片来评估小胶质细胞活化差异，吞噬小胶质细胞的标志物 [34.]。在雌性大鼠中，TRAP 暴露使两种基因型的小胶质细胞活化增加了 3 个月，TgF344-AD 增加了 6 个月大；然而，在暴露于 TRAP 的 15 个月大动物（暴露 14 个月）的两种基因型中，小胶质细胞的活化都降低了 [34.]。暴露于 TRAP 的雄性大鼠在 6 个月大时经历了增强的小胶质细胞激活，在 10 个月时没有变化，在 15 个月时两种基因型的激活程度更高[34.]。这些发现证明了与小胶质细胞反应和 AD 相关的复杂性；小胶质细胞可以作为早期反应者清除 Aβ 斑块，尽管随着斑块的持续存在，它们的存在和募集额外炎症介质的能力可能进一步促进斑块沉积 [16.,32.,34.]。

  

Studies have shown enhanced circulating cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and TNF-β, in AD patients, providing evidence of an elevated inflammatory response, but the relationship between PM exposures and systemic inflammation remains unclear [17.,35.]. A study exposing 11–12-month-old C57BL/6 mice to 1000 μg/m3 of PM0.1 for 3 weeks (8 h/day, 5 days/week) found nonsignificant differences in serum metabolite profiles post-PM0.1 exposure, representing the uncertainty associated with the ability of PM0.1 to induce systemic changes and impact neurological processes through this route [36.]. Of note, transgenic animals were not utilized in this study; thus, the effect of PM alone on AD development is explored rather than its exacerbation of AD; it is unclear whether PM0.1 has comparable potential with PM2.5 to promote an AD phenotype.研究表明，AD 患者的循环细胞因子（如 IL-2、IL-6、IL-1β、TNF-α 和 TNF-β）增强，提供了炎症反应升高的证据，但 PM 暴露与全身 炎症仍不清楚 [17.,35.]。 一项将 11-12 个月大的 C57BL/6 小鼠暴露于 1000 μg/m3 PM0.1 3 周（8 小时/天，5 天/周）的研究发现，暴露于 PM0.1 后血清代谢物谱的差异不显着 ，表示与 PM0.1 通过该途径诱导系统性变化和影响神经过程的能力相关的不确定性 [36.]。 值得注意的是，本研究未使用转基因动物； 因此，只探讨了 PM 对 AD 发展的影响，而不是其对 AD 的恶化； 目前尚不清楚 PM0.1 是否具有与 PM2.5 相当的促进 AD 表型的潜力。

  

Olfactory route

  

The olfactory route is a primary path by which PM reaches the brain, and olfactory dysfunction is an early clinical symptom of AD; thus, the olfactory route is a relevant region to study in the context of PM exposure and AD (Box 3) [37.]. After PM is inhaled through the nose, it translocates from the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb. Continuously exposing C57BL/6 mice to PM2.5 (mean daily 140.18 μg/m3) for 4 or 8 weeks induced changes in the olfactory bulbs, including neuronal apoptosis, cell disorganization, and increased TNF-α signaling [38.]. Transmission electron microscopy revealed particles accumulated in the olfactory bulbs of PM2.5-exposed animals [38.]. Interestingly, several findings from this study, including the increased inflammatory response, were highest after 4 weeks, indicating a compensatory response or tolerance may have been achieved by 8 weeks of PM2.5 exposure [38.]. Within the olfactory bulbs of PM2.5-exposed animals, significantly heightened p-tau levels have been found compared with FA-exposed counterparts [31.]. Significant increases in malondialdehyde, indicative of increased free radicals/oxidative stress, have also been detected in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of PM2.5-exposed animals [31.]. Among PM0.1-exposed animals, inflammatory markers (i.e., TNF-α, IFN-y, and IL-12p70) were found in the olfactory bulb [36.,39.]. Heightened inflammatory markers and increased malondialdehyde suggest early changes seen in AD are associated with the olfactory route of entry, namely, loss of smell [31.,39.]. Altered odor identification is considered a preclinical biomarker of AD; studies have found reduced olfactory performance in children exposed to unhealthy PM levels and an association between heightened PM2.5 levels and odds of developing anosmia (loss of smell), further supporting a clinical connection between the olfactory route changes found among PM-exposed animals [5.,31.,39., 40., 41.].

嗅觉途径是PM到达大脑的主要途径，嗅觉障碍是AD的早期临床症状；因此，嗅觉途径是在 PM 暴露和 AD 的背景下研究的相关区域（框 3）[37.]。 PM 通过鼻子吸入后，它从嗅神经转移到嗅球。将 C57BL/6 小鼠连续暴露于 PM2.5（平均每日 140.18 μg/m3）4 或 8 周可诱导嗅球发生变化，包括神经元凋亡、细胞解体和 TNF-α 信号传导增加 [38.]。透射电子显微镜显示颗粒在暴露于 PM2.5 的动物的嗅球中积累 [38.]。有趣的是，这项研究的一些发现，包括增加的炎症反应，在 4 周后最高，表明在 PM2.5 暴露 8 周后可能已经实现了补偿反应或耐受性 [38.]。在暴露于 PM2.5 的动物的嗅球内，与暴露于 FA 的对应物相比，已发现 p-tau 水平显着升高 [31.]。在 PM2.5 暴露动物的嗅球和海马体中也检测到丙二醛显着增加，表明自由基/氧化应激增加 [31.]。在暴露于 PM0.1 的动物中，在嗅球中发现了炎症标志物（即 TNF-α、IFN-γ 和 IL-12p70）[36.,39.]。炎症标志物升高和丙二醛升高表明 AD 的早期变化与嗅觉进入途径有关，即嗅觉丧失 [31.,39.]。异味识别被认为是 AD 的临床前生物标志物；研究发现，暴露于不健康 PM 水平的儿童嗅觉能力下降，并且 PM2.5 水平升高与发生嗅觉丧失（嗅觉丧失）的几率之间存在关联，进一步支持了在 PM 暴露动物中发现的嗅觉途径变化之间的临床联系。 5.,31.,39., 40., 41.]。

  

PM modes of entry

Particulate size, chemical composition, and chemical solubility are critical in determining whether particles can access the brain [60.,63.,70., 71., 72.]. There are two main proposed routes whereby PM reaches the brain via inhalation: (i) directly from nose to brain via the olfactory bulb, or (ii) indirectly by translocation from the respiratory tract into circulation by bypassing the BBB (Figure I).

Direct delivery of particles or specific chemicals from the nose to the brain occurs via two modes of entry. The first involves transporting inhaled particles from the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb via olfactory receptor cells (Figure I) [63.,72., 73., 74.]. Direct particle transport has been demonstrated in the olfactory nerves of squirrel monkeys, which showed translocation of gold particles anterogradely from olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb [75.]. Similar studies of PM0.1 inhalation exemplify that particles can be translocated from nose to brain in rats [60.,70.]. Furthermore, studies have identified deposits of externally derived, ultrafine magnetite particles in the frontal cells of human brains thought to have entered the brain via the olfactory unit due to the small particle size (<200 nm diameter) [76.]. A second mechanism whereby chemicals or particles are transported from nose to brain is through intercellular clefts in the olfactory epithelium or along nerves [77.]. However, this has only been demonstrated with intranasal administration and not inhalational exposure.

Indirect translocation of particles from the respiratory or intestinal tract into the circulation followed by BBB entry is not a simple process. While translocation of PM0.1 from the lungs to the circulation has been readily shown, the BBB makes it exceptionally difficult for particles, even PM0.1, to traverse [73.,78.]. When rats were exposed to radiolabeled iridium nanoparticles, only an exceptionally small fraction (0.001–0.01%) of particles were found in the brain; smaller nanoparticles (20 nm) were more commonly detected than larger counterparts (80 nm) [78.]. Once the BBB is breached, PM0.1 has been shown to deposit in the striatum, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of rats exposed to ultrafine manganese oxide particles [60.]. Intubation and ventilation of exposed animals prevented particles from translocating directly from nose to brain [78.]. PM can indirectly affect the brain via a systemic inflammation mechanism by infiltrating into the body and stimulating an increase in circulating proinflammatory cytokines in the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, leading to a systemic inflammatory response, microglia activation, and neuroinflammation (Figure I) [79.,80.].PM 进入模式

颗粒大小、化学成分和化学溶解度对于确定颗粒是否可以进入大脑至关重要 [60.,63.,70., 71., 72.]。 PM 通过吸入到达大脑的主要途径有两条：(i) 通过嗅球直接从鼻子到大脑，或 (ii) 通过绕过 BBB 从呼吸道间接转移到循环中（图 I）。

通过两种进入方式将颗粒或特定化学物质从鼻子直接输送到大脑。第一个涉及通过嗅觉受体细胞将吸入的颗粒从嗅觉神经输送到嗅球（图 I）[63.,72., 73., 74.]。已经在松鼠猴的嗅觉神经中证实了直接的粒子转运，这表明金粒子从嗅上皮顺行易位到嗅球[75.]。对 PM0.1 吸​​入的类似研究表明，颗粒可以在大鼠中从鼻子转移到大脑 [60.,70.]。此外，研究已经确定了人类大脑额叶细胞中外部衍生的超细磁铁矿颗粒的沉积物，由于颗粒尺寸小（直径<200 nm），这些颗粒被认为是通过嗅觉单元进入大脑的[76.]。化学物质或颗粒从鼻子运输到大脑的第二种机制是通过嗅觉上皮细胞中的细胞间隙或沿着神经[77.]。然而，这仅通过鼻内给药而不是吸入暴露得到证实。

颗粒从呼吸道或肠道间接转移到循环中，然后进入血脑屏障不是一个简单的过程。虽然 PM0.1 从肺部转移到循环系统已经很容易被证明，但 BBB 使颗粒（甚至 PM0.1）异常难以穿过 [73.,78.]。当大鼠暴露于放射性标记的铱纳米粒子时，大脑中只发现了极少部分（0.001-0.01%）的粒子；较小的纳米颗粒（20 nm）比较大的纳米颗粒（80 nm）更常见[78.]。一旦 BBB 被破坏，PM0.1 就会沉积在暴露于超细氧化锰颗粒的大鼠的纹状体、额叶皮层和小脑中 [60.]。暴露动物的插管和通气可防止颗粒直接从鼻子转移到大脑 [78.]。 PM 可通过全身炎症机制间接影响大脑，通过渗入体内并刺激肺和心血管系统中循环促炎细胞因子的增加，导致全身炎症反应、小胶质细胞活化和神经炎症（图 I）[79。 ,80.]。

PM of various sizes (PM2.5, PM10, PM0.1) is inhaled through the nose and can directly affect the olfactory bulb or follow a peripheral route through the lungs. Upon entering the olfactory system, particulates may infiltrate the olfactory nerve and translocate to the brain. When PM follows the peripheral route, it navigates the respiratory tract and eventually reaches the lungs. Here, PM elicits an inflammatory response; proinflammatory cytokines and particulates subsequently migrate to the bloodstream and into the systemic circulation. After entering the bloodstream, PM and other inflammatory mediators can travel throughout the body and cross the blood–brain barrier due to compromised barrier integrity. PM may also reach the cardiovascular system, where a localized inflammatory response may occur, thus releasing additional inflammatory mediators into the circulation. This reaction may amplify systemic inflammation and ultimately contribute to chronic inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease patients.各种大小的颗粒物（PM2.5、PM10、PM0.1）通过鼻子吸入，可直接影响嗅球或沿外周途径通过肺部。进入嗅觉系统后，微粒可能会渗入嗅觉神经并转移到大脑。当 PM 遵循外周路线时，它会通过呼吸道并最终到达肺部。在这里，PM 引起炎症反应；促炎细胞因子和微粒随后迁移到血液中并进入体循环。进入血流后，PM 和其他炎症介质可在全身传播并由于屏障完整性受损而穿过血脑屏障。 PM 也可能到达心血管系统，在那里可能会发生局部炎症反应，从而将额外的炎症介质释放到循环中。这种反应可能会放大全身炎症并最终导致阿尔茨海默病患者的慢性炎症。

  

Hippocampus

  

The hippocampus is responsible for learning and memory processes and is implicated in AD development [34.]. Studies have demonstrated the ability of PM to initiate neurological effects beyond the olfactory bulb and penetrate barriers within the body and brain [16.,18.,34.]. Findings from TRAP-exposed animals support the hypothesis that PM nanoparticles can translocate to the brain, specifically the hippocampus, as exposed animals possessed visible refractive particles in the hippocampal region [34.]. Hyperspectral brain imaging found a significant increase of hippocampal refractive particles in all TRAP-exposed animals after 3, 6, 10, and 15 months of exposure compared with FA controls [34.]. These findings, paired with the increased microglia activation among TRAP-exposed rats discussed earlier, support the ability of PM to traverse barriers and initiate neuroinflammation [34.]. Significant increases in tau pathology in 3xTgAD mice exposed to PM0.1 (~4%) compared with FA-exposed controls (~2%) were found in the model of aged 3xTgAD mice [16.]. However, this study found no changes in soluble or insoluble Aβ42 concentrations from 3xTgAD hippocampal homogenates [16.]. Microglia were detected via Iba1 staining, but no significant changes were found between exposure groups within the hippocampus [16.]. Yet, when considering the subiculum, an area found to atrophy during the early stages of AD, a significant interaction was found [16.]. Failure to detect changes in Aβ42 concentrations may be explained by the acute PM0.1 exposure (2 weeks) or the genotype selected, though subiculum changes indicate that PM0.1 exposure affects 3xTgAD animals differently than noncarrier controls and may affect Aβ plaque aggregation patterns accordingly [16.,42.].

Park et al. found changed metabolic profiles and Aβ levels in 11–12-month-old C57BL/6 mice exposed to 1000 μg/m3 of PM0.1 compared with control air-exposed animals [36.]. Thirty-one distinct metabolic changes between PM0.1-exposed and control air were visible in the hippocampus postexposure, 25 of which were downregulated [36.]. Of the downregulated metabolites, threonic acid and methionine sulfoxide experienced the greatest reductions [36.]. These findings are of interest as studies indicate threonic acid combined with magnesium salt enhances learning and memory in APPswe/PS1sE9 mice, and AD brains exhibit reduced methionine sulfoxide reductase activity, which reverses methionine sulfoxide back to methionine to clear oxidants [36.,43., 44., 45.]. Additional findings include altered redox homeostasis through the methionine-glutathione pathway in PM0.1-exposed animals and significantly increased Aβ levels in the hippocampus of PM0.1-exposed animals [36.]. Saveleva et al. conducted a shorter study (2 weeks) and found Aβ plaque aggregation was visible in hippocampal and cortical brain regions of transgenic mice, though there were no differences between transgenic animals exposed to PM0.1 (89.5 μg/m3) and control air after 2 weeks (4 h/day, 5 days/week) [39.]. The discrepant findings between Park et al. and Saveleva et al. may be explained by differences in study duration (3 vs. 2 weeks), PM0.1 concentration (1000 vs. 89.5 μg/m3), mouse model (C57BL/6 vs. 5xFAD), and animal age (11–12 vs. 6 months) [36.,39.]. While both studies provide evidence of Aβ plaque aggregation, the findings from Park et al. should be emphasized; with the lack of PM0.1 regulations at this time, the heightened exposure concentration and increased duration show the potential of PM0.1 to promote AD hallmarks in a nontransgenic animal model [36.]. These results may have been achieved by Saveleva et al. had the study been longer, concentration been higher, and animals been older [39.]. Still, evidence of early inflammatory changes associated with AD was found predominately in the hippocampal regions of PM0.1-exposed animals [39.]. A PM0.1 inhalation effect was also detected, as noncarrier control and 5xFAD mice experienced significantly heightened IFN-y and IL-12p70 levels compared with control air-exposed animals [39.]. The increased cytokine levels and elevated mitochondrial superoxide dismutase found indicate significantly greater oxidative stress among animals exposed to PM0.1 in both studies [36.,39.]. Park et al. provide additional support for oxidative stress and inflammation within the hippocampus post-PM0.1 exposure; 4-HNE (oxidative stress marker) was significantly increased in the hippocampus, as was TNF-α [36.].海马体

  

海马体负责学习和记忆过程，并与 AD 发展有关 [34.]。研究表明，PM 能够引发嗅球以外的神经系统影响并穿透身体和大脑内的屏障 [16.,18.,34.]。暴露于 TRAP 的动物的研究结果支持 PM 纳米颗粒可以转移到大脑，特别是海马体的假设，因为暴露的动物在海马区具有可见的折射颗粒 [34.]。高光谱脑成像发现，与 FA 对照组相比，所有 TRAP 暴露动物在暴露 3、6、10 和 15 个月后海马折射颗粒显着增加 [34.]。这些发现与前面讨论的暴露于 TRAP 的大鼠中增加的小胶质细胞活化相结合，支持 PM 穿越障碍并引发神经炎症的能力 [34.]。在老年 3xTgAD 小鼠模型中发现，与暴露于 FA 的对照组（~2%）相比，暴露于 PM0.1 的 3xTgAD 小鼠的 tau 病理学显着增加（~4%）[16.]。然而，这项研究发现 3xTgAD 海马匀浆的可溶性或不溶性 Aβ42 浓度没有变化 [16.]。通过 Iba1 染色检测到小胶质细胞，但在海马内的暴露组之间未发现显着变化 [16.]。然而，当考虑下托时，发现在 AD 早期阶段萎缩的区域，发现了显着的相互作用 [16.]。未能检测到 Aβ42 浓度的变化可能是由于急性 PM0.1 暴露（2 周）或选择的基因型所致，尽管下托的变化表明 PM0.1 暴露对 3xTgAD 动物的影响不同于非携带者对照，并可能相应地影响 Aβ 斑块聚集模式[16.,42.]。

公园等人。发现与暴露于空气的对照动物相比，暴露于 1000 μg/m3 PM0.1 的 11-12 个月大的 C57BL/6 小鼠的代谢特征和 Aβ 水平发生了变化 [36.]。暴露后 PM0.1 和对照空气之间的 31 个不同的代谢变化在海马体中可见，其中 25 个被下调 [36.]。在下调的代谢物中，苏糖酸和蛋氨酸亚砜的减少幅度最大 [36.]。这些发现很有趣，因为研究表明苏酸与镁盐结合可增强 APPswe/PS1sE9 小鼠的学习和记忆力，并且 AD 大脑表现出蛋氨酸亚砜还原酶活性降低，这会将蛋氨酸亚砜逆转回蛋氨酸以清除氧化剂 [36.,43. , 44., 45.]。其他发现包括在暴露于 PM0.1 的动物中通过蛋氨酸-谷胱甘肽途径改变氧化还原稳态，以及在暴露于 PM0.1 的动物中显着增加海马中的 Aβ 水平 [36.]。 Savelev 等人。进行了一项较短的研究（2 周），发现转基因小鼠的海马和大脑皮质区域可见 Aβ 斑块聚集，但暴露于 PM0.1（89.5 μg/m3）和对照空气的转基因动物在 2 周后没有差异（4 小时/天，5 天/周）[39.]。 Park等人之间的差异发现。和 Savelev 等人。可以通过研究持续时间（3 周对 2 周）、PM0.1 浓度（1000 对 89.5 μg/m3）、小鼠模型（C57BL/6 对 5xFAD）和动物年龄（11-12 对6 个月）[36.,39.]。虽然这两项研究都提供了 Aβ 斑块聚集的证据，但 Park 等人的研究结果。应该强调；由于此时缺乏 PM0.1 法规，暴露浓度的提高和持续时间的延长显示了 PM0.1 在非转基因动物模型中促进 AD 标志的潜力 [36.]。 Savelev 等人可能已经取得了这些结果。如果研究时间越长，浓度越高，动物年龄越大 [39.]。尽管如此，与 AD 相关的早期炎症变化的证据主要在暴露于 PM0.1 的动物的海马区域中发现 [39.]。还检测到 PM0.1 吸​​入效应，因为与暴露于空气的对照动物相比，非携带者对照和 5xFAD 小鼠的 IFN-γ 和 IL-12p70 水平显着升高 [39.]。在两项研究中发现的细胞因子水平升高和线粒体超氧化物歧化酶升高表明暴露于 PM0.1 的动物的氧化应激显着增加 [36.,39.]。公园等人。为 PM0.1 暴露后海马体内的氧化应激和炎症提供额外支持； 4-HNE（氧化应激标志物）在海马中显着增加，TNF-α 也是如此 [36.]。

  

Entorhinal and cerebral cortices

  

Continuous exposure of 6-month-old 3xTgAD mice to PM2.5 at a mean concentration of 11.38 μg/m3 for 3 months resulted in reduced cortical neurons in PM-exposed 3xTgAD mice, but visible differences related to neuron loss were not found elsewhere [31.]. Significant reductions in Iba-1 were found in the cerebral cortex of exposed animals, though no changes in Aβ42 were found [31.]. Continuous TRAP exposure resulted in significantly greater neuronal cell loss in the entorhinal cortex of noncarrier control and TgF344-AD animals at 15 months compared with FA-exposed counterparts; TgF344-AD rats had significantly fewer neurons than noncarrier controls [34.]. By 15 months, TRAP-exposed TgF344 animals had significantly higher antiamyloid and Aβ levels compared with FA controls [34.]. Additionally, TRAP-exposed noncarrier control animals expressed significantly higher p-tau:t-tau levels; this change was not consistent among TRAP-exposed transgenic animals [34.].

In vitro models

  

An in vitro model of PM2.5-polluted human brains (PMBs) via a 3D microfluidic platform was created to study the human brain immune response to PM exposures [18.]. After confirming the formation of tight junctions in the model, 0.1–10 μg/ml of PM2.5 was added to the lumen and ultimately precipitated into the brain side of the model when assessed 24 h postexposure [18.]. This precipitation demonstrated the blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity was compromised and subsequent analysis revealed PM2.5 decreased zonula occludens-1 abundance, indicating tight junction downregulation was responsible for reduced BBB function [18.]. PM2.5 treatment also induced astrogliosis and caused microglial infiltration [18.]. Further investigation into the microglial response demonstrated an M1 phenotype as evidenced by enhanced CD11b and CD86 coupled with increased IL-6 and IL-8 by PM2.5 exposure [18.,46.]. Another study treated BV2 cells, a microglial cell line, with 100 μg/ml PM2.5 for 12 h and neuroblastoma N2A cells with a conditioned medium from the BV2 cells for 24 h [38.]. PM2.5-treated BV2 cells exhibited significantly increased TNF-α levels, pointing to direct activation of microglia cells by PM2.5 [38.]. The coculture system resulted in apoptosis among N2A cells, indicating PM2.5 could cause neuronal cell death by inducing systemic inflammation and its associated downstream effects (microglia activation, TNF-α release) or via direct action [38.]. Although several mouse models function to study the pathophysiological effects of PM on AD development, additional in vitro work is necessary to expand our understanding of mechanisms and modifiable factors related to AD and PM exposures, including further elucidation of neuronal and microglia responses to PM [47.].

  

内嗅皮质和大脑皮质

  

将 6 个月大的 3xTgAD 小鼠连续暴露于平均浓度为 11.38 μg/m3 的 PM2.5 3 个月，导致暴露于 PM2.5 的 3xTgAD 小鼠的皮质神经元减少，但在其他地方没有发现与神经元丢失相关的明显差异。 31.]。在暴露动物的大脑皮层中发现了 Iba-1 的显着减少，但没有发现 Aβ42 的变化 [31.]。与暴露于 FA 的对应物相比，持续的 TRAP 暴露导致非携带者对照和 TgF344-AD 动物在 15 个月时内嗅皮层的神经元细胞损失显着增加； TgF344-AD 大鼠的神经元明显少于非携带者对照组 [34.]。到 15 个月时，与 FA 对照相比，TRAP 暴露的 TgF344 动物具有显着更高的抗淀粉样蛋白和 Aβ 水平 [34.]。此外，暴露于 TRAP 的非携带者对照动物表达显着更高的 p-tau:t-tau 水平；这种变化在暴露于 TRAP 的转基因动物中并不一致 [34.]。

体外模型

  

通过 3D 微流体平台创建了 PM2.5 污染的人脑 (PMB) 体外模型，以研究人脑对 PM 暴露的免疫反应 [18.]。在确认模型中形成紧密连接后，将 0.1-10 μg/ml PM2.5 添加到管腔中，并在暴露后 24 小时评估时最终沉淀到模型的大脑侧 [18.]。这种沉淀表明血脑屏障 (BBB) 完整性受到损害，随后的分析显示 PM2.5 降低了 zonula occludens-1 丰度，表明紧密连接下调是导致 BBB 功能降低的原因 [18.]。 PM2.5 处理还诱发星形胶质细胞增生并引起小胶质细胞浸润 [18.]。对小胶质细胞反应的进一步研究证明了 M1 表型，如通过 PM2.5 暴露增强的 CD11b 和 CD86 以及增加的 IL-6 和 IL-8 所证明的 [18.,46.]。另一项研究用 100 μg/ml PM2.5 处理 BV2 细胞（一种小胶质细胞系）12 小时，用来自 BV2 细胞的条件培养基处理神经母细胞瘤 N2A 细胞 24 小时 [38.]。 PM2.5 处理的 BV2 细胞表现出显着增加的 TNF-α 水平，表明 PM2.5 直接激活了小胶质细胞 [38.]。共培养系统导致 N2A 细胞凋亡，表明 PM2.5 可通过诱导全身炎症及其相关的下游效应（小胶质细胞激活、TNF-α 释放）或通过直接作用导致神经元细胞死亡 [38.]。尽管一些小鼠模型可以研究 PM 对 AD 发展的病理生理学影响，但还需要进行额外的体外研究，以扩大我们对与 AD 和 PM 暴露相关的机制和可改变因素的理解，包括进一步阐明神经元和小胶质细胞对 PM 的反应 [47 .]。

  

Concluding remarks

  

Understanding how the environment can affect health and disease progression is important to inform policy as well as design novel mitigation strategies to combat the increase in PM-associated illness. It is apparent that exposure to consistently high levels of PM can have significant effects on AD progression; however, additional studies are needed to understand the mechanisms whereby PM exposure affects the brain and associated organs. Additionally, the majority of studies on PM-induced AD progression have examined PM2.5; therefore, further studies to define the relative contribution of PM0.1 to AD-associated effects are warranted. Determination of such mechanisms will promote prevention and illness alleviation and inform public health policy to enact stricter air quality guidelines. The role of systemic inflammation cannot be emphasized enough in beginning to understand AD progression and severity, and future studies focusing on PM may elucidate methods to delay the onset and/or severity of AD. For instance, it would be helpful to study ‘clean’ versus ‘dirty’ environments and the associated promotion of various neurodegenerative diseases. This review offers immediate strategies for short-term solutions to PM exposure (see Clinician’s corner); also, areas of ongoing scientific inquiry in need of further exploration are highlighted (see Outstanding questions).结束语

  

了解环境如何影响健康和疾病进展对于制定政策以及设计新的缓解策略以对抗 PM 相关疾病的增加非常重要。很明显，暴露于持续高水平的 PM 会对 AD 进展产生显着影响。然而，需要更多的研究来了解 PM 暴露影响大脑和相关器官的机制。此外，大多数关于 PM 诱导的 AD 进展的研究都检查了 PM2.5。因此，需要进一步研究以确定 PM0.1 对 AD 相关效应的相对贡献。确定此类机制将促进预防和减轻疾病，并为公共卫生政策提供信息，以制定更严格的空气质量指南。在开始了解 AD 进展和严重程度时，不能足够强调全身炎症的作用，未来关注 PM 的研究可能会阐明延迟 AD 发作和/或严重程度的方法。例如，研究“干净”与“肮脏”的环境以及各种神经退行性疾病的相关促进会很有帮助。本综述为 PM 暴露的短期解决方案提供了即时策略（见临床医生角）；此外，还强调了需要进一步探索的正在进行的科学探究领域（见悬而未决的问题）。

Mask wearing has been a long-time practice in many large urban areas in Asia and Europe and is now a common global practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further messaging should be developed to encourage individuals to wear proper masks in outdoor spaces on high-pollution days to mitigate development of PM-associated diseases [48.].

Indoor air purifier systems implementing high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters may be implemented throughout homes and businesses to reduce exposure to air particulates of different sizes and compositions [49.].

Sensitive individuals with pre-existing medical diagnoses should be reminded that outdoor activities on days of high pollution are strongly discouraged.

Those who live in heavily polluted areas, or areas with improper ventilation, should be counseled on the potential risks of PM-associated disease development, including AD.

Patients who have the potential for occupational exposure to concentrated PM should be assessed for potential lung and brain effects, and this should be repeated routinely while remaining at risk.

Efforts should be focused on understanding the clinical effects of PM exposure to inform public health legislative bodies to enact stricter air quality control.

在亚洲和欧洲的许多大城市地区，戴口罩一直是一种长期的做法，并且由于 COVID-19 大流行，现在已成为全球普遍的做法。应开发进一步的信息，以鼓励个人在高污染日在户外空间佩戴适当的口罩，以减轻 PM 相关疾病的发展 [48.]。

实施高效微粒空气 (HEPA) 过滤器的室内空气净化器系统可以在家庭和企业中实施，以减少暴露于不同尺寸和成分的空气微粒 [49.]。

应提醒已有医疗诊断的敏感人士，强烈建议不要在高污染日进行户外活动。

应告知居住在重度污染地区或通风不当地区的人有关 PM 相关疾病发展的潜在风险，包括 AD。

应评估可能职业暴露于浓缩 PM 的患者对肺和脑部的潜在影响，并应在保持风险的同时定期重复评估。

应集中努力了解 PM 暴露的临床影响，以告知公共卫生立法机构制定更严格的空气质量控制。

WTC2022

We know that the environment influences AD progression; however, is PM-associated AD reversible?

Will the recent COVID-19 pandemic cause the general public to view mask wearing as a common measure to prevent disease or a nuisance?

While postnatal exposure to environmental toxicants, including PM, is understood to cause systemic inflammation and enhance reactive oxygen species, does in utero, or even preconception, exposure to PM potentiate adulthood development of AD?

Since the data on PM-associated AD have been variable, particularly with regard to the PM source and type, what are the roles of each particulate in AD development? This information will promote effective study designs to combat such associations.

我们知道环境会影响 AD 的进展； 然而，PM 相关的 AD 是可逆的吗？

最近的 COVID-19 大流行是否会导致公众将戴口罩视为预防疾病或滋扰的常见措施？

虽然产后暴露于包括 PM 在内的环境毒物被认为会引起全身炎症并增加活性氧，但在子宫内甚至孕前，暴露于 PM 是否会增强 AD 的成年期发展？

由于 PM 相关 AD 的数据是可变的，特别是关于 PM 来源和类型，每个微粒在 AD 发展中的作用是什么？ 这些信息将促进有效的研究设计来对抗这种关联。

# 2. Grant Example

Specific Aims 

The events of September 11th, 2001 traumatized many Americans. The men and women who aided in rescue and recovery operations at Ground Zero were exposed to an extraordinary array of both emotional and physical exposures (1). Responders saw individuals jump from the towers or lost family members and friends, and also worked for months digging through the pile and in the pit at Ground Zero and inhaled a toxic mix of dust that included neurotoxic agents and resulted in high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (2). In our preliminary work, we identified symptoms consistent with early Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD) in a clinical monitoring program in World Trade Center responders at midlife who participated in rescue and recovery work following the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks after September 11, 2001 (3-8). 

  

We hypothesize that incidence of Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia at midlife may be due to WTC exposures, possibly due to a neuroinflammatory and/or Alzheimer’s-related neuropathological cascade with one result being neurodegenerative disease (9). Critically, neuroimaging work in prevalent WTC-CI suggested that early indications were similar in regional placement to parietal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease (10). Recent efforts to create a WTC neurodegenerative signature using symptomatologic data have suggested that risk of WTC neurodegeneration is determined by both PTSD and WTC exposures. However, our prior programs have been limited to characterization of MCI. To that end, we propose to prospectively phenotype ADRD biomarkers in a study of 700 non-demented WTC responders who vary in level cognitive dysfunction at baseline to examine risk factors for incident dementia. Baseline characterization will include a detailed neuropsychological battery alongside structural magnetic resonance imaging protocol, while longitudinal data collected over 3 waves 1-1.5 years apart will collect detailed neurocognitive, neuromotor, neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and plasma-based biomarkers. Responders will be asked to complete an optional cerebrospinal fluids protocol. Incidence of dementia will be the primary outcome. Rate of cognitive decline and of biomarker change will be secondary outcomes. Fluids-based transcriptomics analysis will examine changes in monocyte regulation. Eligibility will include a brain donation protocol for all participating WTC responders included in this study. 

  

This design addresses our specific aims: 

Aim 1 – To examine linkages between WTC exposure severity and PTSD in relation to risk of incident dementia and, in secondary analyses, with changes in cognition and ADRD-associated serologic biomarkers. Hypotheses: WTC exposures and PTSD will be associated with incidence of dementia, and with the rate of cognitive decline in WTC responders. WTC exposures and PTSD will be prospectively associated with declining β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) alongside increasing phospho-Tau181, Aβ1-40, neurofilament light and heavy chain (NfL/H) as measured in plasma of WTC responders. Apolipoprotein-e4 genotype will play a moderating role in all associations. 

  

Aim 2 – To determine associations of WTC exposure severity and PTSD with cortical atrophy, hippocampal atrophy, and changes in white matter connectivity as measured using MRI. Hypotheses: WTC exposures and PTSD will be associated with decays in cortical thickness and changes in cortical connectivity indicative of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Associations between WTC exposures and PTSD will be moderated by blood-brain barrier dysfunction. 

  

Aim 3 – To determine transcriptomic mechanisms in WTC responders with and without dementia and/or PTSD. Hypotheses: Whole-blood RNA-seq analyses will identify differential expression of neuro-immunologic gene sets. Results from whole-blood data will be mediated by differential expression in monocytes. Results in whole blood will match results in CSF. RNA-Seq analyses will be associated with cortical atrophy and changes in white matter connectivity and extracellular free water distributions. 

  

Exploratory Aim 4 – To begin organ donation in WTC responders who die with and without incident dementia. Hypotheses: All individuals will be required to sign an organ donation card to participate in this study, while the option of organ donation will be provided to the parent cohort more generally. We anticipate collecting 5-10 brains from this program. Collected brains will be sent to the Rush ADRC at time of death. We hypothesize that there will be evidence of amyloidosis and tauopathy alongside metals in the olfactory cortex and cortices in severely exposed WTC responders. 

  

Impact: WTC responders are presenting with symptoms consistent with ADRD at younger ages than expected. We are the only team in the world who can access this patient population; this work has will begin the process to characterize incidence of ADRD in WTC responders at midlife. Findings from the proposed work will help address the onset and treatment of stress-related and/or inhaled particulate matter-related ADRD. 

  

Broad Significance: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) affect millions of Americans and Alzheimer’s disease is the sixth most common cause of death (11, 12). AD has a lifetime risk of 40% in the U.S. population (13, 14). It is a costly disease, with estimates exceeding $236 billion annually. It is the only top cause of death for which neither a prevention nor cure is available (11). ADRD is commonly preceded by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), an interim condition characterized by progressively worsening cognitive function resulting in impairments to functioning (15, 16). These impairments cause dysfunction across various domains of fluid cognition including episodic memory, learning, processing speed, executive functioning, as well as verbal and category fluency (17). These impairments make it increasingly difficult to navigate daily activities. As such, MCI has substantial and important individual, economic, and societal implications (14). Such burden and loss can be scary to patients , caregivers, and family members because it is unpredictable and seemingly irreversible (18). Thus, the NIA is committed to the systematic study of MCI, AD and ADRD (19). 广泛意义: 阿尔茨海默氏病 (AD) 和相关痴呆 (ADRD) 影响数百万美国人，阿尔茨海默氏病是第六大最常见的死亡原因 (11,12)。AD在美国人口中有终生40% 的风险 (13,14)。这是一种昂贵的疾病，估计每年超过2360亿美元。这是唯一既没有预防也没有治愈的主要死亡原因 (11)。ADRD通常先于轻度认知障碍 (MCI)，这是一种以逐渐恶化的认知功能导致功能障碍为特征的临时疾病 (15,16)。这些障碍会导致流体认知的各个领域的功能障碍，包括情景记忆，学习，处理速度，执行功能以及言语和类别流利性 (17)。这些障碍使日常活动变得越来越困难。因此，MCI具有重大而重要的个人，经济和社会影响 (14)。这种负担和损失对患者、护理人员和家庭成员来说可能是可怕的，因为它是不可预测的，而且似乎是不可逆转的 (18)。因此，NIA致力于对MCI，AD和ADRD (19) 进行系统研究。

  

The Alzheimer’srelated neuropathological cascade (orange dotted arrows in Figure 1) is a common cause of MCI. As is clear in the new research framework (20), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is often characterized by the infiltration of Amyloid-β (Aβ) into the brains of its victims, leading to Aβ deposition resulting in increased neurofibrillary tangles made of tau protein and irreversible neurodegeneration (21). The total burden of Aβ is made up of two isoforms Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 that form different types of plaques (dense-core and diffuse plaques). Although less common (22), densecore plaques are more severe and carry increased risk of concomitant tauopathy (23) and neuroinflammatory conditions (24) as well as astrocyte/microglial activation (25). Increased burden of Aβ is critical because even small amounts of Aβ can result in increased buildup of tauopathy (26). Tauopathy is a central pathological feature of AD and accumulating data suggests it is also evident in preclinical CI (21). Τau-protein is a soluble protein that works to effectively glue microtubules together in order to modulate structural stability (27). When damaged, τ-proteins become untethered thereby destabilizing microtubules and causing neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD (20) but also common in neurodegenerative conditions caused by physical damages (28). One theory suggests that neuronal damage occurs when τ-proteins become hyperphosphorylated and begin disassembling neurofilaments (29). Aβ and protein-τ are believed to cause neurodegeneration, which can be defined as the loss of neuronal structural materials including neurofilaments into blood. Neurofilaments are microscopic filaments located in neuronal cytoplasm that help to form the cytoskeleton of the neuron and are critical to maintaining neuronal connections (30). Neurofilaments provide the infrastructure through which neurofilament polymers are transported along the axon itself (31). Neurofilaments are generally classified by relative size (32); neurofilament-light (NfL) is the smallest type, at 70kDa, is small enough to pass easily through the blood-brain-barrier making it a novel marker of neuronal health and of neurodegeneration (33) 阿尔茨海默氏症相关的神经病理级联反应 (图1中的橙色虚线箭头) 是MCI的常见原因。正如在新的研究框架 (20) 中清楚的那样，阿尔茨海默氏病 (AD) 的特征通常是淀粉样蛋白 β (a β) 渗透到其受害者的大脑中，导致a β 沉积导致由tau蛋白和不可逆的神经变性 (21) 组成的神经原纤维缠结增加。A β 的总负担由两种亚型Aβ1-42和Aβ1-40组成，它们形成不同类型的斑块 (致密核和弥漫性斑块)。尽管较不常见 (22)，但densecore斑块更为严重，并且伴随tau病 (23) 和神经炎性疾病 (24) 以及星形胶质细胞/小胶质细胞激活 (25) 的风险增加。A β 的负担增加是至关重要的，因为即使少量的a β 也会导致tau病的积累增加 (26)。Tauopathy是AD的中枢病理特征，积累的数据表明它在临床前CI中也很明显 (21)。Τ au蛋白是一种可溶性蛋白，可有效地将微管粘合在一起，以调节结构稳定性 (27)。当受损时，τ 蛋白变得不受束缚，从而使微管不稳定并引起神经原纤维缠结，这是AD的标志 (20)，但在由物理损伤引起的神经退行性疾病中也很常见 (28)。一种理论表明，当 τ 蛋白过度磷酸化并开始分解神经丝时，就会发生神经元损伤 (29)。A β 和蛋白质-τ 被认为会导致神经变性，这可以定义为包括神经丝在内的神经元结构物质损失到血液中。神经丝是位于神经元细胞质中的微观丝，有助于形成神经元的细胞骨架，对维持神经元连接至关重要 (30)。神经丝提供了神经丝聚合物沿着轴突本身运输的基础结构 (31)。神经丝通常按相对大小分类 (32); 神经丝光 (NfL) 是最小的类型，在70kDa，足够小，可以轻松通过血脑屏障，使其成为神经元健康和神经变性的新标志 (444)

  

A.2. Emerging research suggests that early-life exposures to severely stressful life events often cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with one potential distal outcome being MCI and AD. Common risk factors for MCI and AD include older age, less years of education, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression (34). Research increasingly highlights the impact that chronic accumulation of lifetime stressful events can have influencing late-life health (35), with some researchers noting linkages between stressful life events and late-life cognitive dysfunction in particular (36-38). Studies often reference stress as a cause of dysfunction reported across systems (39-41) and within immunological biomarkers (42-47) with associated disease processes including cardiovascular disease (48), obesity (49), cellular senescence (50), poorer quality of life (51) and increased levels of disability in old age (52). Supporting the view that chronic stress may cause an AD-like condition, a range of studies have now linked exposures to severe and/or chronic traumatic events as a possible risk factor for AD in studies of Veterans and Holocaust survivors (53-56) and, as a result of our work, in WTC responders (8, 55). To date, relatively little is known about why chronic stress might be associated with cognitive decline (53). However, as Spiro, Schnurr, & Aldwin (57) argue, the lasting effects and long-term impact of trauma are often “hidden” by time and by a lack of desire to talk about past traumatic experiences. Nevertheless, multiple theories have emerged to explain this association, suggesting alternatively that 1) the events themselves (especially when including a brain injury) may cause both a chronic stress reaction and cause AD (58-62); 2) PTSD may increase neuropathology resulting in an AD-like condition (63); or 3) PTSD may disrupt neural functioning (64) with reduction of resilience to neuropathology being one result (65-73). The purpose of this study is to characterize cognitive, serologic, and neuroimaging biomarkers for conversion to WTC-related dementia at midlife. A.2. 新兴研究表明，生命早期暴露于严重压力的生活事件通常会导致创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD)，其中一种潜在的远端结果是MCI和AD。MCI和AD的常见危险因素包括年龄较大，受教育年限较少，心血管疾病，糖尿病和抑郁症 (34)。研究越来越多地强调了终身压力事件的慢性积累可能会影响晚年健康的影响 (35)，一些研究人员指出了压力生活事件与晚年认知功能障碍之间的联系 (36-38)。研究通常将压力作为功能障碍的原因报告跨系统 (39-41) 和免疫生物标志物 (42-47) 与相关的疾病过程，包括心血管疾病 (48)，肥胖 (49)，细胞衰老 (50)，生活质量较差 (51) 和老年残疾水平增加 (52)。支持慢性压力可能导致类似AD的观点，一系列研究现已将暴露于严重和/或慢性创伤事件作为退伍军人和大屠杀幸存者研究中的AD可能危险因素联系起来 (53-56)，并且，由于我们的工作，WTC响应者 (8,55)。迄今为止，关于为什么慢性压力可能与认知能力下降有关的了解相对较少 (53)。然而，正如Spiro，Schnurr和Aldwin (57) 所认为的那样，创伤的持久影响和长期影响通常被时间和缺乏谈论过去创伤经历的愿望所 “隐藏”。尽管如此，已经出现了多种理论来解释这种关联，这表明1) 事件本身 (尤其是当包括脑损伤时) 可能会引起慢性应激反应并引起AD (58-62); 2) PTSD可能会增加神经病理学，导致AD样疾病 (63)；或3) PTSD可能会破坏神经功能 (64)，其结果之一是降低对神经病理学的弹性 (65-73)。这项研究的目的是表征中年时转化为WTC相关痴呆的认知，血清学和神经影像学生物标志物。

  

A.4.1. Long-term exposure to inhaled nano-particulate matter may cause cognitive dysfunction and increased risk of CI via a process of tauopathy (solid black arrow in figure 1). Recognizing that WTC exposures may also have independent effects, Clouston et al. (74) used more sensitive measures to examine domain-specific neural dysfunction and identified significant associations between WTC exposures and cognitive dysfunction. Mounting evidence suggests that exposure to air pollutants, especially nano-particulate matter (NPM), also contributes to increased risk of CI. Epidemiologic work has additionally found that CI in children, adults, and the elderly was associated with exposure to various airborne contaminants (75, 76). Imaging studies using structural MRI have identified associations between lifetime exposure and both brain atrophy and disruption in white matter connectivity (77, 78), while work with Dr. Gandy’s lab has found that Aβ increases in animal models exposed for long periods of time to air pollution (79). In epidemiologic work in WTC responders, Clouston et al. also found that WTC exposure duration was associated with memory deficits (8) and, in upcoming work, with incidence of CI (80). Upon infiltration into the brain, NPM would cause physical damage as evidenced by tau burden (81-83). In all these studies, inhalation of airborne NPM is believed to enter into the brain in two possible ways – first, by direct translocation through the olfactory bulb (Fig 1.) causing local damage (84, 85). However, other pathways have been proposed including, for example, that inhaled NPM is sensed as an antigen (Fig 1.), thereby activating a neuroinflammatory response with an Aβ-engaged immune response (86, 87). A.4.1. 长期暴露于吸入的纳米颗粒物质可能会通过tauopathy过程导致认知功能障碍和CI风险增加 (图1中的黑色实心箭头)。认识到WTC暴露也可能具有独立影响，Clouston等人 (74) 使用更敏感的措施来检查域特异性神经功能障碍，并确定了WTC暴露与认知功能障碍之间的显着关联。越来越多的证据表明，暴露于空气污染物，尤其是纳米颗粒物 (NPM)，也会增加CI的风险。流行病学研究还发现，儿童，成人和老年人的CI与暴露于各种空气污染物有关 (75,76)。使用结构MRI进行的成像研究已经确定了终生暴露与脑萎缩和白质连接中断之间的关联 (77,78)，而与Gandy博士的实验室合作发现，长时间暴露于动物模型中的a β 增加空气污染 (79)。在WTC应答者的流行病学工作中，Clouston等人。还发现WTC暴露持续时间与记忆缺陷 (8) 有关，并且在即将进行的工作中，与CI的发生率 (80) 有关。当NPM渗入大脑时，如tau负荷 (81-83) 所证明的那样，NPM会造成物理损伤。在所有这些研究中，空气中NPM的吸入被认为以两种可能的方式进入大脑-第一，通过嗅球直接易位 (图1) 造成局部损伤 (84,85)。然而，已经提出了其他途径，包括，例如，吸入的NPM被感测为抗原 (图1)，从而通过参与a β 的免疫反应激活神经炎症反应 (86,87)。

  

A.4.2. Chronic PTSD may cause an AD-like neuropathological cascade (solid red arrow in Figure 1). PTSD is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing chronic re-experiencing of exposure related memories (reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD) coupled with emotional avoidance and behavioral changes (88). While acute stress is initially adaptive, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokines that decrease buildup of Aβ and improve cognitive performance (89), chronic stress responses can be result in a chronic immune dysregulation (90). PTSD is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing chronic re-experiencing of a memory of the stress exposure (re-experiencing symptoms) coupled with emotional avoidance and behavioral changes (88). Animal models of stress developed to understand the physiologic effects have emphasized the central role that re-experiencing symptoms play when examining distal effects of traumatic exposure (91). Critical to this study, the formation and consolidation of WTC-exposure memories engages the hippocampal-amygdala and parahippocampal (HAP) regions (Fig. 1) resulting in dysregulated and heightened reactivity with improved storage of emotionally-salient stress and trauma experiences (92) and glucocorticoid molecules in the hippocampus to facilitate memory formation (93). The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the core regulating system for the stress response in the context of a stressor (94) and activates glucocorticoid receptors (GR) to help regulate the stress response (95, 96). Furthermore, our group and others have reported altered immune responses in individuals with PTSD across (97-100). However, our recent work has clarified that there are central differences in the  PTSD-CI phenotype including high risk of frailty (101) alongside differences in peripheral markers of inflammation that share characteristics of PTSD and CI but differs in key ways from CI without PTSD (102). A.4.2。慢性创伤后应激障碍可能导致AD样神经病理级联反应 (图1中的红色实心箭头)。创伤后应激障碍是一种异质性疾病，包括与暴露相关的记忆 (创伤后应激障碍的症状) 以及情绪回避和行为改变的慢性再体验 (88)。虽然急性应激最初是适应性的，导致促炎性细胞因子减少a β 的积累并改善认知能力 (89)，但慢性应激反应可能导致慢性免疫失调 (90)。PTSD是一种异质性疾病，包括对压力暴露记忆的慢性再体验 (再体验症状) 以及情绪回避和行为改变 (88)。为了解生理影响而开发的压力动物模型强调了重新经历症状在检查创伤暴露的远端影响时所发挥的核心作用 (91)。对这项研究至关重要，WTC暴露记忆的形成和巩固涉及海马-杏仁核和海马旁 (HAP) 区域 (图1)，导致失调和增强的反应性，改善了情绪显着的应激和创伤经历 (92) 以及海马中的糖皮质激素分子的储存，以促进记忆的形成 (93)。下丘脑-垂体-肾上腺 (HPA) 轴是应激反应的核心调节系统 (94)，并激活糖皮质激素受体 (GR) 以帮助调节应激反应 (95,96)。此外，我们的小组和其他人报告了PTSD个体的免疫反应改变 (97-100)。然而，我们最近的工作已经阐明，PTSD-CI表型存在中心差异，包括脆弱的高风险 (101)，以及具有PTSD和CI特征的炎症外周标志物的差异，但在关键方面与没有PTSD的CI不同 (102)。

  

A.4.3. Monocytes play a pivotal role in explaining the bidirectional relationship of neuroimmune responses involving brain-to-immune and immune-to-brain signaling triggered by psychological stress (103). Emerging evidence implicates a novel neuroimmune circuit involving microglia activation and sympathetic outflow to the peripheral immune system that further reinforces stress-related behaviors by facilitating the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the brain (104-109). Additionally microglial depletion can trigger peripheral macrophage engraftment into the CNS and these cells retain unique transcriptional and functional identity (110). This suggests that peripheral monocytes could influence the disease progression in the CNS. Monocytes gene expression also identified upregulated genes associated with NF-κB transcription factor (111), whereas patients with major depressive disorder showed reduced glucocorticoid receptor alpha/beta expression ratio in monocytes (112). Pro-inflammatory genes also showed increased expression in AD in monocytes (113). CD14++CD16– monocyte subset was associated with defense response, inflammatory response and chemotaxis, whereas CD+CD16++ subset was associated with immune system process and leukocyte migration (114). Our own studies support this interpretation, for example a study in four isolated immune subsets (CD4T, CD8T, B-cells and monocytes) showed an overlap as well as meaningful distinctions between different immune cell types implicated in differential gene expression in PTSD, as well as compared to whole blood (115). We found that gene expression differences in PTSD were largest and most distinct in monocytes. Additionally, in our pilot study of single-cell transcriptomics, we also found the largest changes in expression comparing MCI to control in monocytes. These results suggest that PTSD and AD gene expression studies focusing on monocyte subsets may broaden understanding of the interplay between brain and immune system. Thus, while researchers have long placed Aβ at the beginning of the AD pathological cascade, we propose that PTSD may cause an AD-like disorder or may exacerbate existing AD pathology by causing early proliferation of protein-tau and AB at a more rapid rate (116). A.4.3.单核细胞在解释由心理压力触发的涉及脑对免疫和免疫对脑信号传导的神经免疫反应的双向关系中起关键作用 (103)。新出现的证据暗示了一种新的神经免疫回路，该回路涉及小胶质细胞激活和外周免疫系统的交感神经流出，通过促进炎性单核细胞募集到大脑来进一步加强与压力相关的行为 (104-109)。此外，小胶质细胞耗竭可触发外周巨噬细胞植入CNS，并且这些细胞保留独特的转录和功能特性 (110)。这表明外周单核细胞可能会影响中枢神经系统的疾病进展。单核细胞基因表达还鉴定了与NF-κ b转录因子相关的上调基因 (111)，而患有严重抑郁症的患者在单核细胞中显示出降低的糖皮质激素受体 α/β 表达比 (112)。促炎基因也显示单核细胞中AD的表达增加 (113)。CD14 CD16-单核细胞亚群与防御反应、炎症反应和趋化性相关，而CD16亚群与免疫系统过程和白细胞迁移相关 (114)。我们自己的研究支持这种解释，例如对四个分离的免疫亚群 (CD4T，CD8T，b细胞和单核细胞) 的研究显示了与PTSD中的差异基因表达相关的不同免疫细胞类型之间的重叠以及有意义的区别，以及与全血相比 (115)。我们发现PTSD中的基因表达差异在单核细胞中最大且最明显。此外，在我们对单细胞转录组学的初步研究中，我们还发现了MCI与单核细胞对照相比表达的最大变化。这些结果表明，针对单核细胞亚群的PTSD和AD基因表达研究可能会加深对大脑与免疫系统之间相互作用的理解。因此，尽管研究人员长期将a β 置于AD病理级联的开始，但我们提出PTSD可能导致AD样病症或可能通过以更快的速度引起蛋白质-tau和AB的早期增殖而加剧现有的AD病理 (116)。

  

B. Innovation 1. This study is unique in examining chronic PTSD in a civilian population exposed to a wellcharacterized traumatic event. While a rapidly growing body of work has emerged linking PTSD with incidence of AD (56, 117-131), the bulk of the work has been in older adults and specific trauma exposed populations such as combat veterans or individuals with traumatic brain injury. Studies therefore overlook that exposure to stress and trauma is prevalent in the civilian population without concomitant head injury across the life course. 2. This study will help to resolve if PTSD-related and/or exposure-related MCI in WTC responders is likely to convert to dementia. The WTC cohort is relatively young to be experiencing MCI, and there is evidence from our cohort that PTSD-related CI and CI in highly exposed individuals differs in some non-cognitive symptoms and in some plasma biomarkers, though not in the pattern of cortical atrophy. Identifying biomarkers associated with neurodegeneration and onset of dementia at midlife is time sensitive and crucial to understanding the course of disease in relation to cognitive functioning at midlife. 3. This is the first study to seek to complete monocyte expression profiling in WTC responders with mild cognitive impairment and/or dementia, and the first to examine monocyte expression in individuals with early-onset MCI or dementia. 4. This study extends the first and, to date, only study of cognitive functioning in a large civilian population exposed to repeated and prolonged psychological stressors as a result of a terrorist attack on the United States. WTC responders at mid-life with 1) MCI, 2) elevation of Tau with PET/MRI and 3) increased burden of AD neurodegeneration with novel plasma biomarkers at surprisingly young ages suggesting that WTC exposures may be associated with an AD-like condition. 5. This is the first deep profiling multiplex study of neurological biomarkers including GFAP, Ab, NfL, and pTAU. To that end, we will use deep learning approaches to profile single biomarkers, including using convolutional neuronal networks on neuroimaging efforts, and relying on artificial neuronal networks with hidden layers to profile cognitive and plasma-based biomarkers while trying to determine etiology of effects. 6. These data will be the first to explicitly examine neuropathology in brains of WTC responders. These data will validate results from the peripheral blood analyses that have been completed. Analyses will also help to determine the nature and distribution of AD proteinopathy as well as WTC particulate matter. 7. This is the first large-scale study to examine the hypothesis that PTSD and/or WTC exposures create a novel AD-related dementing illness. B.创新1.这项研究在检查遭受明显创伤事件的平民人群中的慢性PTSD方面是独特的。虽然出现了将PTSD与AD发生率联系起来的快速增长的工作 (56、117-131)，但大部分工作都在老年人和特定的创伤暴露人群中，例如退伍军人或颅脑外伤患者。因此，研究忽略了在整个生命过程中没有伴随头部受伤的平民中普遍存在压力和创伤。2.这项研究将有助于解决WTC应答者中PTSD相关和/或暴露相关的MCI是否可能转化为痴呆。WTC队列相对年轻，正在经历MCI，并且我们的队列中有证据表明，高度暴露的个体中与PTSD相关的CI和CI在某些非认知症状和某些血浆生物标志物上有所不同，尽管在皮质萎缩的模式上没有。识别与中年神经变性和痴呆发作相关的生物标志物对时间敏感，对于理解与中年认知功能相关的疾病过程至关重要。3.这是第一项寻求在患有轻度认知障碍和/或痴呆的WTC应答者中完成单核细胞表达谱的研究，也是第一项检查早发性MCI或痴呆个体中单核细胞表达的研究。4.这项研究扩展了第一项，也是迄今为止唯一一项关于因对美国的恐怖袭击而遭受反复和长期心理压力的大量平民的认知功能的研究。WTC应答者在中年时具有1) MCI，2) PET/MRI升高的Tau和3) 在令人惊讶的年轻时使用新型血浆生物标志物增加了AD神经退行性变的负担，这表明WTC暴露可能与类似AD的疾病有关。5.这是首次对包括GFAP，Ab，NfL和pTAU在内的神经生物标志物进行深度分析的多重研究。为此，我们将使用深度学习方法来分析单个生物标志物，包括在神经成像工作中使用卷积神经元网络，并依靠具有隐藏层的人工神经元网络来分析认知和基于血浆的生物标志物，同时试图确定影响的病因。6.这些数据将是第一个明确检查WTC应答者大脑神经病理学的数据。这些数据将验证已完成的外周血分析结果。分析还将有助于确定AD蛋白病以及WTC颗粒物的性质和分布。7.这是第一个大规模研究，以检验PTSD和/或WTC暴露产生新的AD相关痴呆疾病的假设。

  

Impact for WTC responders, families and policy: Our team is at the forefront of working to systematically identify and understand the etiology and risk factors associated with MCI and neurodegeneration in WTC responders. We have presented results at >10 international conferences as well as 5 WTC-specific conferences in NY. We were also invited to present at the WTC Responder Community Engagement Event in 2018, have received funding for an add-on WTC MRI study (U01 OH011314), and have also been invited to develop and lead a conference funded by the CDC to discuss the implications of this research for clinical and monitoring operations in the WTC cohort. Importantly our work informs the development of future preventive occupational guidelines for disaster response efforts. 对WTC响应者，家庭和政策的影响: 我们的团队致力于系统地识别和了解WTC响应者中与MCI和神经退行性变相关的病因和危险因素。我们已经在超过10次国际会议以及纽约的5次WTC特定会议上展示了结果。我们还应邀出席了世贸中心响应者社区参与活动，2018年获得了一项额外的世贸中心核磁共振成像研究 (U01 OH011314) 的资助，并且还被邀请开发并领导由CDC资助的会议，以讨论这项研究对WTC队列中的临床和监测操作的影响。重要的是，我们的工作为制定未来的防灾职业指南提供了依据。

Responders’ follow-up rates for yearly check-ups have exceeded 82% for the past 13 years. When asked, >96% of WTC Responders regularly provide consent to participate in research studies. Moreover, we currently operate a human tissue biobank as part of the clinical operations that currently contains >10,000 whole blood and serum and >2,000 plasma specimens. Our protocol has already been approved to collect and bank blood on-site and flash-frozen within 30 minutes of retrieval. 参与者 (n = 700) 将来自位于纽约州长岛的石溪大学 (SBU) WTC健康计划 (wtc-hp)。在过去的13年中，响应者对年度检查的随访率已超过82%。当被问到时，&gt; 96% 的WTC响应者定期同意参加研究。此外，我们目前将人体组织生物库作为临床操作的一部分，目前包含&gt; 10,000全血和血清以及&gt; 2,000血浆标本。我们的协议已被批准在现场收集和存储血液，并在检索后30分钟内快速冷冻

This protocol includes researchers across relevant fields, including life course neuroepidemiology (Clouston, PI) and immunological pathology (Kew) using a biobank built by Drs. Luft (Co-I) and Yang (senior lab biologist). These investigators have already successfully assayed neurological biomarkers in this cohort. We also draw on expertise from clinical psychology (Diminich), neuropsychology in aging populations (Richmond), neurobiological changes in ADRD (Kritikos), molecular neurology (Gandy, Co-I), MRI-based imaging of ADRD (Huang), AD measurement and care (M Sano; Co-I), and biostatistics and machine learning (Kuan).

C.2. Setting: The WTC-HP is a clinical population supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). WTC responders were recruited to clinics through extensive outreach campaigns at union meetings, postal questionnaires, media articles, and >50,000 telephone calls in multiple languages (132). Stony Brook’s clinic has enrolled ~10,000 WTC responders living in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island, NY, who worked in rescue and recovery operations during and after 9/11/2001. Attrition has been limited as >85% of responders returning in ≤18 months for follow-up appointments. C.2. 设置: wtc-hp是由疾病控制和预防中心的国家职业安全与健康研究所 (NIOSH) 支持的临床人群。WTC响应者通过工会会议上的广泛宣传活动，邮政问卷，媒体文章和50,000多种语言的电话 (132) 被招募到诊所。斯托尼·布鲁克 (Stony Brook) 的诊所招募了约10,000名居住在纽约州长岛拿骚和萨福克郡的WTC响应者，他们在9/11/2001期间和之后从事救援和恢复工作。减员受到限制，因为&gt; 85% 响应者在 ≤ 18个月内返回进行随访。

  

C.3.1. Epidemiologic data found that WTC responders are at increased risk of mild cognitive impairment. Ongoing work by our team suggests that, on average, WTC responders perform more poorly on computer-assisted measures of cognitive dysfunction when compared to non-WTC exposed normative data (∂~ -0.80). Responders identified as having MCI were highly likely also to do poorly on CogState trials (8), while individuals with poorer cognitive function also were more likely to be APOE4+ (55). Results from the incidence study (Fig. 3) suggested that WTC responders are at increased risk of incident MCI that were higher than individuals who were 10-20-years older at evaluation (133). C.3.1. 流行病学数据发现，WTC应答者发生轻度认知障碍的风险增加。我们团队正在进行的工作表明，与未暴露于WTC的规范性数据 (〜〜-0.80) 相比，WTC响应者在计算机辅助的认知功能障碍测量中的平均表现较差。被确定为患有MCI的响应者在CogState试验中也极有可能表现不佳 (8)，而认知功能较差的个体也更有可能是APOE4 (55)。发病率研究的结果 (图3) 表明，WTC应答者的MCI事件风险增加，高于评估时年龄10-20岁的个体 (133)。

  

C.3.2. Data collection using structural (T1-weighted) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) shows an ADlike pattern of cortical thinning in responders with CI (134). In vivo structural MRI methods allow in-vivo visualization of brain anatomy. Fig. 2A shows cortical thickness clusters, while quantitation shows that a polyNote: Analyses showing decrements (colored from green to red) in cortical thickness using threshold-free cluster enhancement in WTC responders. Colored regions are those that pass correction for multiple comparisons (FDR = 0.05). Figure 3. Cumulative incidence of MCI by PTSD symptom severity  ROI cortical thickness score was excellent at detecting CI in this cohort (AU  C = 0.94) (135). Emerging work is now showing reductions in hippocampal volumes across seven subfields. C.3.2.使用结构 (T1-weighted) 磁共振成像 (MRI) 的数据收集显示了在具有CI的应答者中皮质变薄的类似模式 (134)。体内结构MRI方法可实现脑解剖结构的体内可视化。图2A显示了皮质厚度簇，而定量显示了一个多音符: 分析显示使用WTC响应者的无阈值簇增强，皮质厚度减少 (从绿色到红色)。有色区域是通过多次比较校正 (FDR = 0.05) 的区域。图3。在该队列中，PTSD症状严重程度ROI皮层厚度评分的MCI累积发生率在检测CI方面非常出色 (AU C = 0.94) (135)。新兴的工作现在显示了七个子场海马体积的减少。

  

C.3.3. Pilot studies including tTAU and NfL are suggestive of associations with age, cognitive dysfunction, and MCI in this sample (136). In our pilot study of WTC responders of plasma tauopathy (Tab. 2), several important results emerged. We found moderate correlations between peripheral tau levels and general cognitive performance measured by MoCA and CogState, suggesting that total tau was associated with cognitive dysfunction in this study (r=0.54) with CogState memory and MoCA (r = 0.31). Additionally, results suggest that Ab40 and the Ab40/42 ratio were associated with PTSD (136). C.3.4. Pilot monocyte studies (20 MCI versus 20 control) profiling single cell RNA-Seq of these subjects using the CITE-Seq platform which combines multiplexed protein marker detection with unbiased transcriptome profiling of single cells (137, 138) retained 1,434 (SD = 495) and 1,602 (SD = 278) per sample in discovery and replication sets. Several major immune subsets were detected, namely B-Cell (5.5%), CD4T (33.7%), CD8T (17.4%), NK (10.1%), DC (1.7%), Monocytes (21%) in the discovery cohort. Differential expression (DE) analysis identified 444 genes to be associated with MCI in the discovery set in monocytes among which 226 were replicated. Among the 226 DE genes associated with MCI in monocytes, 85 genes were unique to total monocytes, i.e. not DE in other cell types of which 80 were upregulated. The top five genes have been linked to a human leukocyte antigen differences in AD (HLA-DRB6) (139), cytokine response expressed by neurons and microglia in AD post-mortem brains (CCL3) (140), Aβ generation (141) and protein kinase C alteration (142) (MARCKS), Aβ precursor protein metabolism and tau phosphorylation (NR4A1) (143), and interferons charged with antiviral effects (GBP2) (144, 145) and dysregulated in AD (146). In fact, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was one of three KEGG pathways associated with the 85 genes unique to total monocytes (FDR < 0.05) including toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways that were shown to be positively associated with an increased risk of developing AD (147) and to microglial-mediated inflammatory response involved in promoting AD pathogenesis (148). C.3.5. Pilot analysis of acceptability of organ donation protocols in WTC responders. Since 2011, a total of 5% of the sample has died with deaths being concentrated among older WTC responders. For example, estimated mortality rates in the parent cohort were estimated to be approximately 1.5 per 1,000 person-years in WTC responders aged 50-59, and 9.1/1,000 person-years in responders aged 70-79. Additionally, surveys of WTC responders completed during self-reports suggest that Using these data, we estimate that during the period of this award between 90-190 responders with valid cognitive impairment assessments will die in the parent cohort, while estimates are that approximately 5-11 responders included in this dementia study will die during data collection efforts. C.4. Sample. The source population consists of responders who are monitored at the WTC clinics in Long Island, NY, and who have been followed up regularly as part of our first Aging study. While nearly all were exposed to a vast array of psychological trauma, some 54.7% arrived on site on 9/11/2001 when ambient dust exposure was extensive; and 28.8% were physically caught in the dust cloud. For this study, we will recruit 700 individuals who are in the clinical sample who meet screening criteria for MCI and dementia. C.4.1. Study protocol. The study has as its goal the interrogation of neurocognitive decline and change in plasma-based biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in a study of WTC responders. All eligible responders will fulfill three possible case statuses: 1) cognitively normal, 2) mildly cognitively impaired, and 3) possible mild dementia. These responders will complete a complex longitudinal follow-up protocol that entails 3 major steps: 1) they will be enrolled into an additional neurocognitive and blood-based biomarkers study and to 2) complete a brief magnetic resonance imaging protocol at each visit while 3) also agreeing to sign an anatomical gift act to allow the research team to collect their brain tissue at time of death. C.3.3. 包括tTAU和NfL在内的试点研究提示了该样本中与年龄、认知功能障碍和MCI的关联 (136)。在我们对血浆tauopathy的WTC应答者的初步研究中 (表2)，出现了一些重要结果。我们发现外周tau水平与MoCA和CogState测量的一般认知表现之间存在中等相关性，这表明在本研究中，CogState记忆和MoCA (r = 0.31) 的总tau与认知功能障碍相关 (r = 0.54)。此外，结果表明Ab40和Ab40/42比率与PTSD (136) 相关。C.3.4.使用CITE-Seq平台分析这些受试者的单细胞RNA-Seq的先导单核细胞研究 (20 MCI与20对照)，该平台结合了多重蛋白质标记检测和单细胞的无偏转录组分析 (137，138) 在发现和复制集中保留每个样本的1,434 (SD = 495) 和1,602 (SD = 278)。在发现队列中检测到几个主要的免疫亚群，即b细胞 (5.5%)，CD4T (33.7%)，CD8T (17.4%)，NK (10.1%)，DC (1.7%)，单核细胞 (21%)。差异表达 (DE) 分析在单核细胞的发现集中鉴定了444与MCI相关的基因，其中226被复制。在单核细胞中与MCI相关的226个DE基因中，85个基因对于总单核细胞是唯一的，即在80个被上调的其他细胞类型中不是DE。前五个基因与AD中的人类白细胞抗原差异 (HLA-DRB6) (139)，AD死后大脑中的神经元和小胶质细胞表达的细胞因子反应 (CCL3) (140)，a β 产生 (141) 和蛋白激酶C改变 (142) (MARCKS)，A β 前体蛋白代谢和tau磷酸化 (NR4A1) (143)，以及具有抗病毒作用 (GBP2) (144，145) 和AD中失调的干扰素 (146)。事实上，爱泼斯坦-巴尔病毒 (EBV) 感染是与总单核细胞特有的85个基因相关的三个KEGG途径之一 (FDR &lt;0.05)，包括toll样受体 (TLR) 和NOD样受体 (NLR) 信号途径，这些途径被证明与发生AD的风险增加呈正相关 (147) 和小胶质细胞介导的炎症反应参与促进AD发病机制 (148)。C.3.5。WTC响应者器官捐赠协议可接受性的初步分析。自2011年以来，共有5% 的样本死亡，死亡集中在年龄较大的WTC响应者中。例如，在50-59岁的WTC应答者中，父母队列中的估计死亡率估计为约1.5/1,000人-年，在70-79岁的应答者中估计为9.1/1,000人-年。此外，在自我报告期间完成的对WTC响应者的调查表明，使用这些数据，我们估计在该奖项期间，具有有效认知障碍评估的90-190响应者将在父母队列中死亡，据估计，这项痴呆症研究中包括的大约5-11名响应者将在数据收集过程中死亡。C.4。样本。源人群由在纽约州长岛的WTC诊所进行监测的响应者组成，并作为我们首次衰老研究的一部分定期进行随访。虽然几乎所有人都遭受了各种各样的心理创伤，但当环境粉尘暴露广泛时，一些54.7% 人9/11/2001到达现场; 28.8% 人被尘埃云困住了。在这项研究中，我们将招募符合MCI和痴呆症筛查标准的临床样本中的700个人。C.4.1. 研究方案。该研究的目标是在WTC应答者的研究中询问神经认知功能下降以及基于血浆的阿尔茨海默氏病和相关痴呆的生物标志物的变化。所有合格的响应者将满足三种可能的病例状态: 1) 认知正常，2) 轻度认知受损和3) 可能的轻度痴呆。这些响应者将完成复杂的纵向跟进协议，该协议需要3个主要步骤: 1) 他们将参加一项额外的神经认知和基于血液的生物标志物研究，并2) 在每次访问时完成简短的磁共振成像协议，同时3) 还同意签署一项解剖学礼物法案，以允许研究团队在死亡时收集他们的脑组织。

  

C.5.2. Eligibility criteria: All eligibility criteria will be confirmed at an in-person assessment. Inclusion criteria: 1) consented to participate in research, 2) eligible and willing to complete neuroimaging and bloodwork, 3) willing to sign an anatomical gift act. Exclusion criteria: 1) drinking problem or current substance abuse disorder; 2) history of stroke; 3) history of serious head trauma or other neurological disorders such as epilepsy; 4) currently receiving cognitively active medications (e.g., methylphenidate); 5) brain cancer; 6) multiple sclerosis. Neuroimaging eligibility differs slightly as discussed in the human subject’s section. C.3.2. Ethics: Written consent for the proposed study will be obtained at the serologic retrieval component of the cognitive monitoring visit.  C.3.3. Feasibility: We have an existing in-clinic wet lab and biobank (see resources) that includes serial serum available for all WTC responders in the cognitive monitoring study and is now able to measure plasma in all responders. At the time of the grant submission, we were collecting plasma for ten eligible subjects per day. This has allowed us to develop a cross-sectional pilot database (Tab. 2) on 450 individuals using the proposed protocol assays, and neuroimaging differences shown in Fig. 2 show recruitment capacity for neuroimaging. C.4.2. Generalizability: WTC Responders are at higher risk of PTSD and were exposed to unknown toxins, reducing their generalizability to other cohorts. However, the PTSD evident in this cohort is not confounded by concomitant Traumatic Brain Injury and is also not experienced in a warzone but, instead, was unavoidable and near their homes making the source of PTSD more akin to PTSD received by civilians in other disasters. To ensure generalizability, we over-sample more severely WTC-exposed and responders with PTSD at a rate of 2:1. “Exposure-based” and “characteristic-based” sampling methods provide results that are generalizable to source populations (149). Selection probabilities are encoded as model weights. C.4.4. Possible Missing Data: Some responders elect not to complete cognitive testing, in part because they have previously scored poorly on the cognitive assessments and/or because they are afraid of taking the assessment. These same responders, however, provide blood for research at a rate of 99.7%. To examine the influence of missing cognitive data, we propose to integrate responders who refused cognitive assessment. As such, the responders eligible for biomarker assessment will be selected from those who completed cognitive assessments. This effort will improve generalizability and may help us determine the extent to which refusal of cognitive testing is associated with neuropathological burden. C.5.2. 资格标准: 所有资格标准将在面对面评估中得到确认。纳入标准: 1) 同意参加研究，2) 有资格并愿意完成神经影像学和血液检查，3) 愿意签署解剖学礼物法案。排除标准: 1) 饮酒问题或当前的药物滥用障碍; 2) 中风史; 3) 严重头部外伤或其他神经系统疾病 (例如癫痫) 史; 4) 目前正在接受认知活性药物 (例如哌醋甲酯); 5) 脑癌; 6) 多发性硬化症。如人类受试者部分所述，神经成像资格略有不同。C.3.2. 伦理: 将在认知监测访问的血清学检索部分获得拟议研究的书面同意。C.3.3. 可行性: 我们有一个现有的临床湿实验室和生物库 (参见参考资料)，其中包括可用于认知监测研究中所有WTC应答者的系列血清，现在能够测量所有应答者的血浆。在提交赠款时，我们每天为10名符合条件的受试者收集血浆。这使得我们能够使用所提出的方案测定来开发关于450个体的横断面试验数据库 (Tab. 2)，并且图2中所示的神经成像差异显示了神经成像的募集能力。C.4.2. 广泛性: WTC应答者患PTSD的风险较高，并且暴露于未知毒素，从而降低了他们对其他队列的广泛性。然而，在这一群体中明显的创伤后应激障碍并不与伴随的创伤性脑损伤混淆，也没有在战区经历，而是不可避免的，在他们的家附近，使得创伤后应激障碍的来源更类似于其他灾难中平民接受的创伤后应激障碍。为了确保通用性，我们以2:1的速度对更严重的WTC暴露和PTSD应答者进行了过度采样。“基于暴露” 和 “基于特征” 的采样方法提供可推广到源人群的结果 (149)。选择概率被编码为模型权重。C.4.4. 可能的缺失数据: 一些响应者选择不完成认知测试，部分原因是他们以前在认知评估中得分较低和/或因为他们害怕接受评估。然而，这些相同的响应者以99.7% 的速度为研究提供血液。为了检查缺失的认知数据的影响，我们建议整合拒绝认知评估的响应者。因此，有资格进行生物标志物评估的应答者将从那些完成认知评估的人中选择。这项工作将提高通用性，并可能帮助我们确定拒绝认知测试与神经病理学负担相关的程度。

  

C.4.1. Structural Neuroimaging: Protocol for MRI Acquisition. Prior to administering the research PET/MRI protocol, a dual echo sequence is also obtained to screen for incidental abnormalities. Structural MRI images will be acquired for anatomical delineation via an anatomical T1-weighted MPRAGE (TR/TE = 1900/2.5ms, FOV = 23cm, Matrix 256x256, slice thickness = 0.87 mm), T2* imaging will be performed using a complex value single-exponential fitting and a T2-FLAIR image will be incorporated to examine, QSM imaging (8 echoes at 6.2, 12.4, 18.6, 24.8, 31, 37.2, and 43.6 ms; repetition time = 55 ms; flip angle = 15°; slice thickness = 2mm, in-plane resolution = 1x1 mm2). Cortical thickness measures will be automatically generated for each subject for subsequent group analysis. We will also perform manual ROI delineation for ROIs deemed critical for study aims. A cortical risk score will be derived pursuant to our structural MRI study (n = 60) using an established cutoff (score = 1.17), and results will be linked to changes in neurodegenerative disease burden (150). In addition to cortical thinning analyses, we will perform volumetric analyses using standard methods. Additionally, since we are concerned that exposure may have caused tauopathy, QSM maps will be generated using morphology-enabled dipole inversion with nonlinear formulation in order to measure the levels of ferromagnetic materials in the brain. To account for potential cerebrovascular disease burden, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI (repetition = 11,000 ms, echo time = 147 ms, inversion time = 2,250 ms, 256 × 192 matrix, 1 repetition, bandwidth 16 kHz, 24-cm field of view, and 3-mm interleaved images of the whole head will quantify white mater hyperintensity volume. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in 64 directions will be run through a series of tests for artifacts common to diffusion images. The diffusion image will then be corrected for distortion induced by the gradient coils and simple head motion using the eddy current correction routine within FSL (FMRIB Software Library). DSI Studio will be used to reconstruct the tensor image. The elements of the diffusion tensor matrix (eigenvalues λ1, λ2 and λ3) will be used to calculate axonal diffusivity (AD, λ1), mean diffusivity (MD, mean of λ1, λ2 and λ3), radial diffusivity (RD, mean of λ2 and λ3), and fractional anisotropy (FA). 3D maps of these parameters will be generated. ANTS (Advanced Normalization Tools) will be used to register the diffusion image to the de-skulled MPRAGE image and apply the inverse transformation to the cortical map to put the ROIs into DTI space for analysis. Diffusion tractography will be performed with DSI Studio using an orientation distribution function (ODF)-streamline ROIbased approach. Tracts will be mapped with an ODF-streamline version of the FACT algorithm. Mean AD, MD, RD, and FA parameters will be composited across tracts included in signatures of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease described previously.29,32 Markers of small vessel disease will be Peak width of Skeletonized Mean Diffusivity (PSMD). DTI data will be skeletonized using the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics procedure (TBSS) in FSL as described previously.229 PSMD will be derived from the final MD skeletons calculated as the difference between the 95th and 5th percentiles of the voxel-based MD values within the skeleton. The Dipy diffusion imaging library230 includes free-water elimination model231 and will be used to calculate diffusion metrics. This model assumes that each voxel contains two components: an anisotropic tissue-bound component and an isotropic extracellular free water component. To calculate these components, white and gray matter masks from Freesurfer 7 will be aligned with each subject’s free-water image using bbregister232 and ANTS SyN nonlinear registration.233 Mean free-water values will be calculated across all voxels within gray and white matter masks separately for each subject. C.4.1. 结构神经成像: MRI采集方案。在执行研究PET/MRI协议之前，还获得了双重回波序列以筛查偶然异常。将通过解剖T1-weighted mplage (TR/TE = 1900/2.5 ms，FOV = 23厘米，矩阵256x256，切片厚度 = 0.87毫米) 获取结构MRI图像以进行解剖描绘，t2 * 成像将使用复数值单指数拟合进行，并将T2-FLAIR图像合并以检查QSM成像 (在6.2、12.4、18.6、24.8、31、37.2和43.6 ms处有8个回波; 重复时间 = 55 ms; 翻转角度 = 15 °；切片厚度 = 2毫米，平面内分辨率 = 1x1mm2)。将为每个受试者自动生成皮质厚度度量，以进行后续的组分析。我们还将对被认为对研究目标至关重要的ROI进行手动ROI描绘。根据我们的结构MRI研究 (n = 60)，使用已确定的临界值 (得分 = 1.17) 得出皮质风险评分，结果将与神经退行性疾病负担的变化 (150) 相关。除了皮质变薄分析外，我们还将使用标准方法进行体积分析。此外，由于我们担心暴露可能导致tauopathy，因此将使用具有非线性公式的形态学支持的偶极子反转来生成QSM图，以测量大脑中铁磁材料的水平。为了解决潜在的脑血管疾病负担，液体衰减反转恢复 (FLAIR) MRI (重复 = 11,000 ms，回波时间 = 147 ms，反转时间 = 2,250 ms，256 × 192矩阵，1重复，带宽16 kHz，24cm视场，整个头部的3毫米交错图像将量化白色材料的高强度体积。64个方向的扩散张量成像 (DTI) 将通过一系列扩散图像常见的伪影测试进行。然后，扩散图像将被校正由梯度线圈和使用涡流的简单头部运动引起的失真FSL (FMRIB软件库) 内的当前校正例程。DSI Studio将用于重建张量图像。扩散张量矩阵的元素 (特征值 λ1，λ2和 λ3) 将用于计算轴突扩散率 (AD，λ1)，平均扩散率 (MD，λ1，λ2和 λ3的平均值)，径向扩散率 (RD，λ2和 λ3的平均值)，和分数各向异性 (FA)。这些参数的3D图将被生成。蚂蚁 (高级归一化工具) 将用于将扩散图像配准到去skulled MPRAGE图像，并将逆变换应用于皮质图以将roi放入DTI空间进行分析。扩散追踪将被使用方向分布函数 (ODF)-流线型ROIbased方法与DSI Studio一起执行。将使用事实算法的ODF-流线型版本进行映射。平均广告，MD，RD和FA参数将在包含在先前描述的阿尔茨海默病和帕金森氏病特征中的各个区域中进行合成。29，32小血管疾病的标记将是骨骼化平均扩散率 (PSMD) 的峰宽。DTI数据将使用FSL中的基于道的空间统计程序 (TBSS) 进行骨骼化，如前所述。229 PSMD将从最终的MD骨骼中得出，计算为第95和第5个百分位数之间的差骨架内的基于体素的MD值。Dipy扩散成像库230包括自由水消除模型231，并将用于计算扩散度量。该模型假设每个体素包含两个分量: 各向异性组织结合成分和各向同性细胞外游离水成分。要计算这些成分，freesurfer 7的白质和灰质遮罩将使用bbregister232和ANTS SyN非线性注册与每个受试者的自由水图像对齐。233平均自由水值将分别针对每个受试者计算灰质和白质遮罩内的所有体素。

  

C.4.1.2. ROI Justification: Vulnerable cognitive domains include learning, memory, executive functions, and information processing speed, which have been functionally linked to frontal, cingulate and medial temporal cortices (151-158). Previous work in animal models (159-164) and postmortem human samples (165, 166), as well as in our preliminary data show high vulnerability in hippocampus and cortical structures. Theories about exposure-related tauopathy suggest that WTC dust may intrude on the olfactory cortex and may cause an immune response resulting in hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal (HAP) degeneration. In our cortical analyses of PTSD, CTX was most extensive in the superior temporal cortex, an ROI that was also implicated in an imaging study of older veterans with PTSD (167). To examine the olfactory and entorhinal regions, both the DK and AAL atlases will be used to calculate SUVRs. C.4.2. Fluids-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration: Collection methods: Whole blood samples from WTC responders will be collected in K2-EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and put on-ice, then centrifuged at 2000g for 15 mins at 4°C. Responders will also be asked to complete an optional cerebrospinal fluid collection routine using a spinal tap; CSF will be processed and stored in the same facility as plasma samples. Fluids samples will be separated and placed into polyethylene tubes before being stored at 80°C until shipping. Samples will be transported with dry ice package to be assayed at Quanterix™ labs. Quanterix™ (see letter of support) provides the following markers as one of a number of “multiplex” arrays. Analyses will be completed using Simoa technologies. Samples are diluted at a 1:4 ratio in phosphorate-buffered saline with 2% bovine serum albumin diluent prior to assays. This cutting-edge technology utilizes light reflecting from beads placed into minute amounts of plasma to measure the protein levels and has a lower limit of detection (LLOD) <0.1 pg/ml; >1,000 times more sensitive than conventional immunoassays (168). Multiplex analysis allows for more affordable assessment. Data sheets contain information about LLODs and coefficients of variation. Pilot data found that proposed measures had acceptable levels of variation that were above the LLOD. Fluids Measures: Amyloid (Ab42 & Ab40) are proteins that reside in the periphery and are believed to play a role in the neuroimmune response and are a central characteristic in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Ab40 and Ab42 are central markers for the AD process and each is believed to cause different types of neuritic plaque, with Ab40 being critical to the formation of denser plaques and Ab42 more commonly associated with the types of diffuse plaques that make up most plaques in AD. Total Tau protein (tTAU) is the biological glue that helps to keep microtubules in the axons and neurons in line and functioning and is primarily located in the neuron that consists of six isoforms in the brain. It is small (48-67kDA depending on isoform) enough to pass through the BBB and, therefore, to be found in the plasma. Early work suggests that tTAU is elevated in AD (169) and with head trauma (170). Unfortunately, one early study claimed that tTAU was not associated with tauopathy on PET/MRI (171); however, their study actually shows a large (d=5.2-6.3 SD) increase in ptTAU among tau-positive MCI and AD cases. More recent work has again clarified the utility of ptTAU in identifying AD neuropathology (172-174). Phosphorylated tau protein (pTau) is a subset of tau proteins that have become phosphorylated due to Alzheimer’s disease in particular and is thus a more specific marker (See data sheets); we believe that either pxTau or its elevation in relation to baseline ptTau using the ratio (pxTau/ptTau). Plasma Neurofilament-Light (pNfL) utilizes plasma to identify NfL. NfL forms a critical component of the microtubule array that helps to pass nutrients and maintain neuronal integrity. NfL is a small (70kDA) component of the neuronal cytoskeleton that provides structural support to axons but is small enough to pass through the BBB. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a class-III intermediate filament expressed by astrocytes, including microglia, in the central nervous system (175). These cells are able to navigate the brain’s parenhyma and support, guide, nurture, and organize other cellular activities. GFAP is small (55kDA) and can polymerize with other proteins and neurofilaments including NfL. GFAP is highly reproducible see data sheet) but non-specific and associated with traumatic brain injury (170) and neurodegeneration (176). C.4.1.2. ROI理由: 脆弱的认知领域包括学习，记忆，执行功能和信息处理速度，它们在功能上与额叶，扣带回和内侧颞皮层相关 (151-158)。先前在动物模型 (159-164) 和死后人类样本 (165，166) 以及我们的初步数据中的工作表明，海马和皮质结构具有很高的脆弱性。关于暴露相关的tauopathy的理论表明，WTC粉尘可能侵入嗅觉皮层，并可能引起免疫反应，导致海马，杏仁核和海马旁 (HAP) 变性。在我们对PTSD的皮质分析中，CTX在上颞叶皮质中最广泛，这种ROI也与对患有PTSD的老年退伍军人的影像学研究有关 (167)。为了检查嗅觉和内嗅区域，将使用DK和AAL地图集来计算SUVRs。C.4.2. 基于流体的神经变性生物标志物: 收集方法: 将来自WTC响应者的全血样品收集在K2-EDTA血液收集管 (BD Vacutainer，Franklin Lakes，NJ) 中，并放在冰上，然后在4 °C下以2000g离心15分钟。还将要求响应者使用spinal tap完成可选的脑脊液收集程序; CSF将与血浆样品一起处理并存储在同一设施中。流体样品将被分离并放入聚乙烯管中，然后在80 °C下储存直至运输。样品将与干冰包装一起运输，以在Quanterix进行分析。™实验室。Quanterix™(请参阅支持函) 提供以下标记作为多个 “多路复用” 阵列之一。分析将使用Simoa技术完成。在测定之前，用2% 牛血清白蛋白稀释剂在磷酸盐缓冲盐水中以1:4比率稀释样品。这种尖端技术利用从放置在微量血浆中的珠子反射的光来测量蛋白质水平，并且具有检测下限 (LLOD) &lt;0.1 pg/ml;&gt; 比常规免疫测定 (168) 敏感的1,000倍。多重分析可以进行更实惠的评估。数据表包含有关LLODs和变异系数的信息。试点数据发现，拟议的措施具有高于lod的可接受的变化水平。流体测量: 淀粉样蛋白 (Ab42和Ab40) 是存在于外围的蛋白质，被认为在神经免疫反应中起作用，并且是阿尔茨海默氏病发病机理的核心特征。Ab40和Ab42是AD过程的中心标记，据信每种标记都会引起不同类型的神经性斑块，其中Ab40对形成较致密的斑块至关重要，而Ab42通常与构成大多数斑块的弥漫性斑块类型相关在AD中。总Tau蛋白 (tTAU) 是一种生物胶，有助于使轴突和神经元中的微管保持一致并起作用，并且主要位于由大脑中的六个同工型组成的神经元中。它很小 (取决于同工型的48-67kDA)，足以通过BBB，因此可以在血浆中找到。早期研究表明，tTAU在AD (169) 和头部创伤 (170) 中升高。不幸的是，一项早期研究声称tTAU与PET/MRI上的tau病无关 (171); 然而，他们的研究实际上显示tau阳性MCI和AD病例中ptTAU的大量增加 (d = 5.2-6.3 SD)。最近的工作再次阐明了ptTAU在识别AD神经病理学中的效用 (172-174)。磷酸化的tau蛋白 (pTau) 是tau蛋白的子集，尤其是由于阿尔茨海默氏病而被磷酸化，因此是更具体的标记 (参见数据表); 我们认为，使用比率 (pxTau/ptTau)，pxTau或其相对于基线ptTau的升高。血浆神经丝光 (pNfL) 利用血浆来识别NfL。NfL形成了微管阵列的关键组成部分，有助于传递营养物质并保持神经元的完整性。NfL是神经元细胞骨架的一小部分 (70kDA)，可为轴突提供结构支持，但足够小以通过BBB。胶质纤维酸性蛋白 (GFAP) 是由中枢神经系统 (175) 中的星形胶质细胞 (包括小胶质细胞) 表达的III类中间丝。这些细胞能够导航大脑的功能，并支持，引导，培育和组织其他细胞活动。GFAP很小 (55kDA)，可以与包括NfL在内的其他蛋白质和神经丝聚合。GFAP是高度可重现的，参见数据表)，但是非特异性的，并且与创伤性脑损伤 (170) 和神经变性 (176) 相关。

  

C.4.3. Monocyte profiling: Flow cytometry and total RNA isolation from flow sorted monocytes: Sorting is performed on a BD FACSAria II sorter an aliquot of 15 million cells obtained from frozen PBMCs (thawed, restored, washed, counted, resuspended in PBS/BSA, filtered and diluted). The sort selection criteria includes gating on single cells, CD45positive and Live-dead negative events, and CD14-positive cells (monocytes). Fractions up to 1 million cells are collected into tubes containing 0.5 ml PBS/BSA. Small samples are taken from the collected fractions for postsorting purity analysis. The purification of total RNA is prepared using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One to two million frozen, flow-sorted cells are immediately lysed and resuspended. The lysate is then left at room temperature to allow for adequate cell lysis. After addition of chloroform, the homogenate is then separated by centrifugation. RNA which partitions to the upper, aqueous phase is extracted, and ethanol is added to provide appropriate binding conditions for all RNA molecules from 18 nucleotides upwards. The sample is then applied to the RNeasy Mini spin column, where the total RNA binds to the membrane and phenol and other contaminants are efficiently washed away. High quality RNA is then eluted in 60 ul of RNase-free water. Quantitative assessment of the purified total RNA is then accomplished by using a Qubit Broad Range RNA kit (Thermofisher). The RNA is further evaluated qualitatively by a 4200 Tapestation (Agilent technologies). Whole transcriptome (RNA-seq): The sequencing libraries are prepared with the RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase (HMR)kit (Roche Sequencing Solutions), from 500ng total RNA following manufacturer’s instructions which includes ribosomal depletion, samples purification, fragmentation and for cDNA synthesis. Fragmented RNA is then reverse transcribed, undergo adapter ligation, PCR amplification, Pure Beads purification, and validation for appropriate size on a 4200 TapeStation D1000 Screentape (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The DNA libraries are quantitated using KAPA Biosystems qPCR kit, and are pooled together in an equimolar fashion. Each pool is denatured and diluted with 1% PhiX control library added. The resulting pool is then loaded into the appropriate NovaSeq Reagent cartridge, as determined by the number of sequencing cycles desired, and sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (Illumina Inc.). RNA-Seq data preprocessing: Alignment is performed using the TopHat2 software(177) which utilizes Bowtie2(178) (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) on RefSeq (NCBI Reference Sequence Database) annotation and human reference genome (GrCh37-hg19 version)(179). Spliced alignment of the reads to the reference genome is done with the TopHat2 software allowing a maximum of one mismatch per read; quality control was done using RSeQC. Other genomic related data are obtained using UCSC's genome repository.(180) Quality control for raw reads is performed with FastQC,(181) and adapter trimming is done with cutadapt(182). From the mapping results, the number of reads aligning to each gene is calculated using HTSeq (183). The raw count data is transformed into fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and transcript per million mapped reads (TPM) to account for library size differences. Estimation of batch effects: The potential for batch effects is estimated from the log-normalized gene counts data using surrogate variable analysis approach for sequencing data (svaseq)(184). The estimated surrogate variables are included in differential expression analyses as adjustment factors. C.4.3.单核细胞分析: 流式细胞术和从流式分选单核细胞隔离总RNA: 在BD FACSAria II分选器上进行分选，等分来自冷冻pbmc的1500万细胞 (解冻、恢复、洗涤、计数、重悬于PBS/BSA、过滤和稀释)。分类选择标准包括对单细胞、cd45阳性和活死阴性事件以及CD14-positive细胞 (单核细胞) 的门控。将多达100万个细胞的级分收集到含有0.5毫升PBS/BSA的管中。从收集的馏分中提取少量样品以进行分选后的纯度分析。使用miRNeasy迷你试剂盒 (Qiagen) 制备总RNA的纯化。立即裂解一至200万冷冻的流动分选细胞并重新悬浮。然后将裂解物留在室温下，以进行足够的细胞裂解。加入氯仿后，然后通过离心分离匀浆。分离到上部的RNA，提取水相，并添加乙醇，为从18个核苷酸向上的所有RNA分子提供适当的结合条件。然后将样品施加到RNeasy Mini spin色谱柱上，其中总RNA与膜结合，苯酚和其他污染物被有效洗去。然后在60 ul无核糖核酸酶的水中洗脱高质量的RNA。然后通过使用Qubit宽范围RNA试剂盒 (Thermofisher) 完成纯化的总RNA的定量评估。通过4200 Tapestation (安捷伦技术) 进一步定性地评估RNA。全转录组 (RNA-seq): 测序文库是用RNA超制备试剂盒与核糖擦除 (HMR) 试剂盒 (罗氏测序溶液) 制备的，从500ng总RNA按照制造商的说明，包括核糖体耗竭，样品纯化，片段化和cDNA合成。然后片段化RNA被逆转录，在4200 TapeStation D1000 Screentape (Agilent Technologies，inc.) 上进行适配器连接、PCR扩增、纯珠粒纯化和适当大小的验证。使用KAPA Biosystems qPCR试剂盒对DNA文库进行定量，并以等摩尔的方式汇集在一起。每个池都被变性和稀释，加入1% PhiX对照库。然后将所得的池装入合适的NovaSeq试剂盒中，由所需的测序循环数确定，并按照制造商推荐的协议 (Illumina Inc.) 在NovaSeq6000上进行测序。RNA-Seq数据预处理: 使用TopHat2软件 (177) 执行比对，该软件利用Bowtie2(178) (http:// RefSeq (NCBI参考序列数据库) 注释和人类参考基因组 (GrCh37-hg19版本)(179) 上的bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)。读数与参考基因组的拼接比对是用TopHat2软件完成的，允许每次读数最多不匹配；使用RSeQC进行质量控制。使用UCSC的基因组存储库获得其他基因组相关数据。(180) 使用FastQC进行原始读数的质量控制，(181) 使用cutadapt(182) 进行适配器修剪。从映射结果来看，使用HTSeq (183) 计算与每个基因比对的读段数。原始计数数据被转化为每百万个映射读段 (FPKM) 和每百万个映射读段 (TPM) 的转录段，以解释文库大小差异。批效应的估计: 使用测序数据的替代变量分析方法 (svaseq)(184) 从对数标准化基因计数数据中估计批处理效应的潜力。估计的替代变量作为调整因子包含在差异表达分析中。

  

C.4.4. Objective indicators of cognitive function and impairment: Diagnosis of Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Dementia are completed algorithmically following the NIAAAIC established guidelines (185). To accomplish this task, we will use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a clinical screening tool. The MoCA collects information from a broad array of domains of fluid cognition, such as executive function, memory, and visuospatial capability, that are known to be sensitive to cognitive aging. Validated subtests exist for this including the orientation, trails-B processing times, and episodic memory (186). The MoCA is highly sensitive to MCI and dementia (187, 188). Cognitive domains have been validated using the MoCA and can be sensitive enough to improve rate of decline. Due to regulations at the CDC pertaining to liability for dementia-related care costs, we are not allowed to contact responders’ families for the purposes of diagnosing dementia. We therefore follow an algorithmic diagnostic routine: Fluid cognition will be measured using derived from the Cogstate Brief Battery as well as the Groton Maze Learning and Memory tests and the Continuous Paired Associated Learning tasks. Each task includes between 30-88 independent trials, with overall measures being averaged across all trials within each task. These measures utilize a computer-administered approach (189) that uniformly measures fluid cognition using data and metadata during a game-like task. Domains measured include: reaction speed, processing speed, cognitive efficiency, intra-item response variability (the variance in response rate to repeated tasks over time (190, 191)), attention, executive function, verbal memory, visual memory, and working memory and takes approximately 35 minutes to administer. Validity checks are built into scoring methods. Studies of adults and children have shown limited practice effects with repeat administration during a day or over a year (192-194). Responders are considered as having possible dementia if CogState scores show substantial cognitive dysfunction in two domains of cognitive functioning, and there is indication of cognitive decline. Concerns about patient’s capacity for managing healthcare are recorded within clinical acuity scores. Self-reported memory declines and prevalent Cognitive limitations will be measured using the Alzheimer’s-disease (AD8) checklist (195). Additional related measures: Physical functioning will be measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; nia.nih.gov), an objective measure of physical limitations developed by Dr. Jack Guralnik (136, 196) that relies on standing balance, chair-rise speed, and walking speed. Though not a formal part of the SPPB, grip strength was incorporated alongside SPPB measures since it is an aging biomarker (197) and will be measured using computerized Vernier dynamometers (www.vernier.com). Our data has identified associations with PTSD symptom severity with both the SPPB score and (198) and grip strength (199). The Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), a validated measure identifying changes in behaviors seen in ADRD (200). In WTC responders, MBI is reliable (Cronbach’s alpha=0.98) and associated with MCI (AUC=0.73) and fairly common: for example, 12% of responders reporting impulse control problems. C.4.4. 认知功能和损害的客观指标: 轻度认知障碍 (MCI) 和痴呆的诊断按照NIAAAIC建立的指南 (185) 在算法上完成。为了完成这项任务，我们将使用蒙特利尔认知评估 (MoCA) 作为临床筛查工具。MoCA从广泛的流体认知领域收集信息，例如执行功能，记忆和视觉空间能力，这些信息已知对认知衰老敏感。为此存在经过验证的子测试，包括方向、跟踪B处理时间和情景记忆 (186)。MoCA对MCI和痴呆高度敏感 (187，188)。认知领域已使用MoCA进行了验证，并且可以足够敏感以提高下降率。由于疾病预防控制中心关于痴呆症相关护理费用责任的规定，我们不允许为了诊断痴呆症而联系响应者的家人。因此，我们遵循算法诊断例程: 将使用Cogstate Brief电池以及Groton迷宫学习和记忆测试以及连续配对的相关学习任务来测量流体认知。每个任务包括30-88个独立试验，每个任务中所有试验的总体测量平均。这些措施利用计算机管理的方法 (189)，其在类似游戏的任务期间使用数据和元数据统一地测量流体认知。测量的领域包括: 反应速度、处理速度、认知效率、项目内反应变异性 (对重复任务的响应率随时间的变化 (190、191)) 、注意力、执行功能、言语记忆、视觉记忆和工作记忆，并且需要大约35分钟来管理。有效性检查内置于评分方法中。对成人和儿童的研究表明，在一天或一年以上的时间内重复给药的实践效果有限 (192-194)。如果CogState评分在认知功能的两个领域显示出实质性的认知功能障碍，并且有认知功能下降的迹象，则认为响应者可能患有痴呆症。对患者管理医疗保健能力的担忧记录在临床敏锐度评分中。自我报告的记忆力下降和普遍的认知局限性将使用阿尔茨海默氏病 (AD8) 检查表 (195) 进行测量。其他相关措施: 将使用短物理性能电池 (SPPB; nia.nih.gov) 来测量身体功能，这是Jack Guralnik博士 (136，196) 开发的一种物理限制的客观度量，该度量依赖于站立平衡，椅子上升速度和步行速度。尽管不是SPPB的正式部分，但由于其是老化生物标志物 (197) 并且将使用计算机化的游标测功机 (www.vernier.com) 测量握力与SPPB测量一起合并。我们的数据已经确定了与PTSD症状严重程度与SPPB评分和 (198) 以及握力 (199) 的关联。轻度行为损害检查表 (mbi-c)，一种确认ADRD中行为变化的有效措施 (200)。在WTC响应者中，MBI是可靠的 (Cronbach&#39;s alpha = 0.98)，并且与MCI相关 (AUC = 0.73)，并且相当普遍: 例如，报告冲动控制问题的响应者的12%。

  

C.4.3. Indicators of World Trade Center exposures and related diseases: WTC-PTSD was assessed during monitoring visits using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV conditions with WTC exposures assessed as the index trauma for all responders (201). We use diagnosed PTSD trajectories following 9/11: most individuals in the clinical sample fall into three broad trajectories: resilient, which includes individuals who did not experience PTSD after 9/11 (77.4% of the population); remitting, which includes individuals who experienced short-term WTC-related PTSD directly after 9/11 but have improved since (7.2% of the population); and chronic as 15.6% of WTC Responders experienced PTSD 13 years after 9/11 (202). NonWTC PTSD was also assessed, and lifetime traumas were recorded. PTSD symptom severity were measured starting at baseline, as early as 2002, and have been updated serially until WTC responders’ most recent monitoring visit. Our team has previously reported longitudinal analyses of symptom severity (203) relying on the PTSD checklist (PCL-S). Prior work has noted that re-experiencing symptoms are less sensitive to reverse causation from brain aging (55), and ongoing work has linked re-experiencing symptoms to cortical thinning. Trauma severity was assessed by clinicians during the first visit using a structured history survey. Traumatic events include exposure to the dust cloud, the collapse site (commonly called the “pit” or “pile”); human remains; search and rescue efforts; traumatic death of a friend, colleague, or family member on 9/11 (see appendix for codebook). Results were integrated into an exposure severity index using previously validated protocols (204). We also note that the literature is clear that long-term exposures to airborne particulate matter are particularly important to increased risk of AD and, critically, that these exposures need to be to nanoparticles that are smooth and rounded rather than sharp, suggesting that exposures to dust later in the process after dust has been pulverized and burnt for weeks or months may be more impactful. We therefore additionally note the length of time that each responder spent working in the dust-exposed areas (pile and pit) at the WTC. At our prior study baseline, we collected a version of the Life Events Checklist for DSM-V that was modified to include childhood bullying and to clarify timing of traumatic event. We have published associations between chronic PTSD, lifetime stressful events and childhood adversity in WTC responders (205). C.4.3. 世界贸易中心暴露和相关疾病的指标: wtc-ptsd在监测访问期间使用dsm-iv条件的诊断访谈时间表进行了评估，WTC暴露被评估为所有响应者的创伤指数 (201)。我们使用以下9/11的诊断PTSD轨迹: 临床样本中的大多数个体分为三个大致的轨迹: 弹性，包括9/11后没有经历PTSD的个体 (人口的77.4%); 缓解，其中包括在9/11后直接经历短期与WTC相关的创伤后应激障碍但此后有所改善的个体 (占人口的7.2%); 以及WTC应答者的慢性as 15.6% 在9/11后13年经历了创伤后应激障碍 (202)。还评估了非wtc PTSD，并记录了终生创伤。从基线开始测量PTSD症状严重程度，最早于2002年，并连续更新，直到WTC响应者最近一次监测访问。我们的团队先前报告了依赖于PTSD检查表 (pcl-s) 的症状严重程度 (203) 的纵向分析。先前的工作已经指出，重新经历的症状对大脑衰老的反向因果关系不太敏感 (55)，并且正在进行的工作已经将重新经历的症状与皮质变薄联系起来。在首次就诊期间，临床医生使用结构化的历史调查评估了创伤的严重程度。创伤事件包括暴露于尘埃云、坍塌部位 (通常称为 “坑” 或 “堆”); 人类遗骸; 搜索和救援工作; 9/11上朋友、同事或家人的创伤死亡 (见附录代码本)。使用先前验证的方案 (204) 将结果整合到暴露严重度指数中。我们还注意到，文献清楚地表明，长期暴露于空气中的颗粒物对于增加AD的风险尤为重要，并且至关重要的是，这些暴露必须是光滑，圆形而不是尖锐的纳米颗粒，这表明在粉尘被粉碎和燃烧数周或数月后的过程中暴露于粉尘中可能会产生更大的影响。因此，我们还注意到每个响应者在WTC的灰尘暴露区域 (桩和坑) 工作所花费的时间长度。在我们先前的研究基线中，我们收集了dsm-v的生活事件清单版本，该清单经过修改以包括童年欺凌并阐明创伤事件的发生时间。我们已经在WTC响应者中发表了慢性PTSD，终生压力事件和儿童逆境之间的关联 (205)。

  

C.4.5. Selected Covariates/Confounders: Self-reported problem drinking was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-10), where a score of eight is often used to differentiate between regular and hazardous drinking (206, 207). Body mass was measured using nurse-measured weight and height; BMI was calculated in the standard way (kg/m2). Lifetime smoking was assessed using NIDA survey items. Physical activity will be assessed using the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) (208). Current diagnoses of major depression (MDD) and substance abuse disorder (SA) are clinically diagnosed. The prevalence of substance abuse is low in WTC responders (<1%). MDD has been estimated to be prevalent in 8.3% WTC responders (vs. 3.4% in the general population (209)). Cardiovascular disease is characterized in these data in a number of ways. First, we have detailed and longitudinal information about mean arterial, diastolic, and systolic blood pressure for all clinic visits. We further access diagnosed cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarctions, chronic heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack. Body mass (kg/m2) is measured among responders using nurse evaluations of responders’ weight. Apolipoprotein-e4 status is a common risk factor for ADRD and appears to moderate the impact of dust exposures on neurocognitive functioning and risk of AD. APOE4 is already available for all participants to be included in this study and can therefore be used as a potential confounder. Additionally, Polygenic risk scores will be available for all WTC responders as part of a separate funding mechanism (U01 OH011864). While not available at the time of grant-writing, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from serum collected during monitoring interviews and SNP genotyping is being performed using the Illumina Omni2.5 Beadchip (210) at Roswell Park. Polygenic risk will be calculated in a standard way (211). C.4.5. 选定的协变量/混杂因素: 使用酒精使用障碍识别测试一下 (AUDIT-10) 评估自我报告的问题饮酒，其中通常使用8分来区分常规饮酒和危险饮酒 (206、207)。使用护士测量的体重和身高来测量体重; BMI以标准方式 (kg/m2) 计算。使用NIDA调查项目评估终生吸烟。将使用国际体育活动问卷 (IPAQ) (208) 评估体育活动。目前对重度抑郁症 (MDD) 和药物滥用障碍 (SA) 的诊断是临床诊断的。在WTC应答者中，药物滥用的发生率较低 (&lt;1%)。据估计，MDD在8.3% WTC响应者中普遍存在 (与普通人群中的3.4% 相比 (209))。这些数据以多种方式表征了心血管疾病。首先，我们提供了有关所有诊所就诊的平均动脉，舒张压和收缩压的详细和纵向信息。我们进一步访问诊断为心血管疾病，例如心肌梗塞，慢性心力衰竭，外周动脉疾病，中风，短暂性脑缺血发作。使用护士对响应者体重的评估来测量响应者的体重 (kg/m2)。Apolipoprotein-e4状态是ADRD的常见危险因素，似乎可以减轻粉尘暴露对神经认知功能和AD风险的影响。APOE4已经可供所有参与者纳入本研究，因此可以用作潜在的混杂因素。此外，作为单独的筹资机制 (U01 OH011864) 的一部分，所有WTC响应者都可以获得多基因风险评分。虽然在授权撰写时不可用，但从监测访谈期间收集的血清中提取脱氧核糖核酸 (DNA)，并且正在使用Roswell Park的Illumina Omni2.5 Beadchip (210) 进行SNP基因分型。多基因风险将以标准方式 (211) 计算。

  

Non-WTC stressors: Head injuries were identified using semi-structured interviews; a lifetime history of head trauma was taken, and each head trauma was characterized as a loss of consciousness, a concussion. Head traumas relating to 9/11 were noted, some qualitative descriptions were provided, and responders further reported whether they had been assessed for TBI. Responders with a TBI or any military head injury are ineligible. Current Stressful Life events: At each monitoring visit, the clinic collects an inventory of stressful life events including, for example, divorce, job loss, incident disability, violence, etc. We have, in addition, asked about pre- and post-9/11 stressful life experiences using a variant of the Life Experiences Checklist (212), which asks about timing of life events and a greater range of experiences including peer violence (205). Comorbid brain injury and brain cancers were excluded from our study. However, as this cohort is at high risk of developing cancer, it is also crucial that we control for potential pre-cancerous changes in brain functioning. To that end, a fourth indicator of neuronal health is available in the multiplex array provided by Quanterix™: Ubiquitin carboxyl hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1). UCH-L1 is expressed predominantly in neurons and is one of the most abundant brain proteins representing 1-2% of all soluble brain protein. UCH-L1 has been linked with regulation of ubiquitin pool, apoptosis, and with learning and memory. While UCH-L1 has been theorized to be important in Parkinson’s disease (213), it has been consistently linked to a range of oncogenic studies (214) including, cancer metastasis (215) and glioma (216) justifying its utility as a cancer biomarker here. Sociodemographic factors measured in the parent study: Occupation in September 2001 was asked of all WTC Responders. Occupation may define types of 9/11 exposures. It also defines whether individuals had previously completed disaster preparedness training. Prior research has noted that PTSD rates in police are lower than among non-traditional Responders (217). Race/Ethnicity is commonly associated with health disparities and is known to influence the prevalence of APOE-ε4; participation by individuals from disparities backgrounds including Blacks (10%) and Hispanics (12%) are similar in this study to regional population reference groups. Sex is a common confounder in epidemiological research and is a source for bias in studies examining both the risk of PTSD and of fatigability. This study will over-select women MCI patients to ensure that results are sufficiently powered when adjusting for sex. Age in days will be collected at the time of visit and transformed to years for the purposes of analysis. Education is associated with cognitive aging (218) and measured by the WTC monitoring program among all responders. Most (94.6%) WTC responders have ≥12 years of formal schooling, with 32.3% having a university degree. Reason for refusal and assessor identifier are collected to aid in missing data bias quantification. 非WTC压力源: 使用半结构化访谈识别头部受伤; 记录了一生的头部外伤史，每次头部外伤都被描述为意识丧失，脑震荡。记录了与9/11有关的头部创伤，提供了一些定性描述，并进一步报告了响应者是否对TBI进行了评估。患有TBI或任何军事头部受伤的响应者不符合资格。当前的压力生活事件: 在每次监测访问时，诊所都会收集压力生活事件的清单，包括离婚，失业，事故残疾，暴力等。此外，我们还使用生活经历清单 (212) 的变体询问了9/11前后的压力生活经历，该清单询问生活事件的时间安排以及包括同伴暴力在内的更多体验 (205)。合并脑损伤和脑癌被排除在我们的研究之外。但是，由于该队列处于罹患癌症的高风险中，因此控制大脑功能的潜在癌前变化也至关重要。为此，Quanterix提供的多路复用阵列中提供了第四个神经元健康指标™: 泛素羧基水解酶L1 (UCH-L1)。UCH-L1主要在神经元中表达，并且是代表所有可溶性脑蛋白的1-2% 的最丰富的脑蛋白之一。UCH-L1与泛素池的调节，细胞凋亡以及学习和记忆有关。虽然UCH-L1已被理论认为在帕金森氏病 (213) 中很重要，但它一直与一系列致癌研究 (214) 相关联，包括癌症转移 (215) 和神经胶质瘤 (216)，证明了其作为癌症生物标志物的效用。父母研究中测量的社会人口统计学因素: 所有WTC响应者都询问了2001年9月的职业。职业可以定义9/11暴露的类型。它还定义了个人以前是否已经完成了备灾培训。先前的研究指出，警察中的PTSD比率低于非传统响应者 (217)。种族/民族通常与健康差异相关，并且已知会影响APOE-ε4的流行; 本研究中，来自黑人 (10%) 和西班牙裔 (12%) 等不同背景的个人的参与与区域人口参考群体相似。性别是流行病学研究中的常见混杂因素，并且是研究PTSD风险和易疲劳性的研究中的偏见来源。这项研究将过度选择女性MCI患者，以确保在调整性别时结果具有足够的动力。在访问时将收集以天为单位的年龄，并将其转换为年以进行分析。教育与认知老化 (218) 相关，并由WTC监测计划在所有响应者中进行测量。大多数 (94.6%) WTC响应者具有 ≥ 12年的正规教育，32.3% 具有大学学位。收集拒绝原因和评估者标识符，以帮助丢失数据偏差量化。

  

C.5. Proposed Analyses Overview: Descriptive analyses will report missing data, means, standard deviations, percentages, and distributional characteristics in this population. T-tests will be used to examine bivariate differences in dichotomous outcomes including PTSD and MCI. Analyses will be conducted using Stata 16/SE software [StataCorp]. All analyses will report reasons for missing data, response and attrition rates, and will also incorporate novel methods for accounting for missing data as noted in the missing data section. Hypothesis testing (two-tailed a = 0.05) will adjust for multiple comparisons (FDR = 0.05) as appropriate (219). Incidence of dementia will be examined in responders with MCI, semi-parametric survival modeling will rely on Cox proportional hazards modeling (220). The outcome will be censored at the time of incident dementia or loss to follow-up. The proportional hazards assumption will be tested using Schoenfeld residuals. We will fit the following expected modeling structure: ℎ(𝑡) = ℎ!(𝑡) ∗ exp (𝛽"𝑃 + 𝛽#𝑊 + 𝛽𝐹 + 𝛽%𝐴 + 𝛽&𝑅 + 𝜷𝒊𝑿𝒊) (1) where measures include P for PTSD, W for WTC exposure severity, F for female, A for age, R for Race/Ethnicity (note that because this is a multinomial variable B4 will actually indicate a vector of coefficients indicating race/ethnicity), and X indicates an array of confounders biomarkers used as predictors. Longitudinal analysis will rely on a mix of novel modeling approaches. First, we will examine changes in outcomes using GLM modeling (221, 222). This approach will allow us to examine the rate of change in neurological indicators and cognitive functioning outcomes over time while accounting for the individual differences in outcomes at baseline and adjusting for the potential for heteroskedasticity in growth curves over time (223), a commonly used approach to modeling trajectories of cognitive change (224). Models will account for learning occurring following baseline assessments (225). Unstructured covariance matrices allow examination of associations between intercepts and slopes, often reflective of regression to the mean (223). Analyses will examine equation 3: 𝐿(𝑁𝑀()) = (𝛽! + 𝛽"𝑃 + 𝛽#𝑊 + 𝛽$𝐹 + 𝛽%𝐴 + 𝛽&𝑅 + 𝛾!() ∗ (1 + 𝑡) + 𝜀() (2) Temporally invariant confounders may help to explain more rapid rates of decline, while time-variant confounders may help to explain immediate changes in cognition. The error term includes random error (εit), individual-specific random intercepts (γi0) accounting for time-invariant factors differences in capability, and random slopes (γi1t) modeling individual-specific rates of change and account for heteroskedasticity common in growth models. The prior modeling effort makes the assumption that predictors of one outcome are independent of predictors of another related outcome, such as tTAU. Since each outcome is unique, we propose to complete analyses utilizing dual correlated-outcomes methods. Data will be outcome- as well as time-stacked and modelled according to the view that each is an indicator of a latent process. The outcome, therefore, will be latent change indicated by observed changes across measures of AD neuropathology (NP). Aim 1 will be supported if B1 and/or B2 are associated with increased incidence of dementia in eq. 1; or B3 and B4 are statistically significance in eq. 2 when examining changes in ADRD proteomic measures. Aim 2 will be supported in equation 1 if the coefficient (Bi) for cortical thickness is associated with incidence of dementia (eq. 1) or if B3 or B4 are associated with cortical atrophy (eq. 2). C.5. 建议的分析概述: 描述性分析将报告缺失的数据、均值、标准差、百分比和该人群的分布特征。T检验将用于检查二分结局 (包括PTSD和MCI) 的双变量差异。分析将使用Stata 16/SE软件 [StataCorp] 进行。所有分析都将报告丢失数据的原因，响应和流失率，并且还将采用新的方法来处理丢失数据，如丢失数据部分所述。假设检验 (双尾a = 0.05) 将根据需要调整多重比较 (FDR = 0.05) (219)。将在MCI应答者中检查痴呆症的发生率，半参数生存模型将依赖于Cox比例风险模型 (220)。结果将在痴呆或失访时审查。比例风险假设将使用Schoenfeld残差进行测试。我们将符合以下预期的建模结构: “” (”) =“ ”!(𝑡) ∗ exp (𝛽&quot; 𝑃 + 𝛽 # 𝑊 + 𝛽 $ 𝐹 + 𝛽 % 𝐴 + & & 𝑅 + 𝜷𝒊𝑿𝒊 𝒊) (1) 其中测量包括PTSD、WTC暴露严重程度的W、女性的F、年龄的A、R表示种族/民族 (请注意，因为这是多项式变量B4实际上将指示指示种族/民族的系数向量)，而X表示用作预测因子的混杂生物标志物的阵列。纵向分析将依赖于多种新颖的建模方法。首先，我们将使用GLM模型检查结果的变化 (221 333)。这种方法将使我们能够检查神经系统指标和认知功能结果随时间的变化率，同时考虑基线时结果的个体差异，并调整随时间增长曲线异方差的可能性 (223)，这是一种常用的方法建模认知变化的轨迹 (224)。模型将说明在基线评估之后发生的学习 (225)。非结构化协方差矩阵允许检查截距和斜率之间的关联，通常反映回归到均值 (223)。分析将考察方程3: 𝐿(𝑁𝑀()) = (𝛽! + 𝛽 &quot;𝑃 + 𝛽 # 𝑊 + 𝛽 $ 𝐹 + 𝛽 % 𝐴 + 𝛽 & 𝑅 + 𝛾!() ∗ (1 + 𝑡) + 𝜀() (2) 时间不变的混杂因素可能有助于解释更快的下降速度，而时间不变的混杂因素可能有助于解释认知的即时变化。误差项包括随机误差 (ε it)，个体特定的随机拦截 (γi0) 考虑了能力的时不变因素差异，和随机斜率 (γ i1t) 对个体特定的变化率进行建模，并解释增长模型中常见的异方差。先前的建模努力使得一个结果的预测因子独立于另一个相关结果的预测因子，如tTAU。由于每个结果都是唯一的，我们建议使用双重相关结果方法来完成分析。数据将是结果以及时间堆叠，并根据每个都是潜在过程的指标的观点进行建模。因此，结果，将是通过AD神经病理学 (NP) 测量的观察变化所指示的潜在变化。如果B1和/或B2与方程1中痴呆的发病率增加相关，则将支持Aim 1；或者B3和B4在公式2中具有统计学意义，当检查ADRD蛋白质组学测量的变化时。如果皮质厚度的系数 (Bi) 与痴呆的发生率相关 (公式1)，或者如果B3或B4与皮质萎缩相关 (公式1)，目标2将在公式1中得到支持。2)。

  

Aim 3 – To determine transcriptomic mechanisms in a case-control study of WTC responders with and without incident dementia, PTSD, or severe WTC exposures. Differential expression analyses of RNA-Seq data generated from isolated monocytes is performed using DESeq2(226) software based on multivariable negative binomial generalized linear models that adjusted for age, race and estimated surrogate variables to account for potential batch effects. Genes with low expression are filtered using the cpm (count-per-million) function in edgeR (227). Statistical significance is assessed via the Wald test using appropriate contrasts to identify differentially expressed genes associated with dementia and/or PTSD. A false discovery rate (FDR)(228) control is used to account for multiple testing. FDR < 0.05 is used to identify statistically significant genes. The above implies, in effect, that cognitive dysregulation occurs as a result of an ADRD process at greater rates among responders with PTSD. However, an alternative explanation is that responders with PTSD are experiencing changes to neural functioning resulting in increased susceptibility to the effects of extant neuropathology. As defined in the recent Whitepaper on cognitive reserve (73) and elucidated further in Nat Rev Neuroscience (229), the promise of cognitive reserve is that it provides neural efficiency in the face of neuropathological burden resulting, as shown in (230), in both later onset of cognitive symptoms and more rapid post-onset cognitive declines. As such, we would expect that insofar as PTSD reduces cognitive reserve, that it will result in an increased level of association between neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction. Aim 3 will be supported if RNA transcriptomics are dysregulated in responders with WTC-dementia and if WTC responders with PTSD or severe WTC exposures are exacerbated as compared to. 目的3-在有和没有发生痴呆，PTSD或严重WTC暴露的WTC应答者的病例对照研究中确定转录组机制。使用基于多变量负二项广义线性模型的DESeq2(226) 软件对从分离的单核细胞产生的RNA-Seq数据进行差异表达分析，所述多变量负二项广义线性模型针对年龄、种族和估计的替代变量进行调整以考虑潜在的批次效应。使用edgeR (227) 中的cpm (百万计数) 功能过滤低表达的基因。通过Wald测试一下使用适当的对比来评估统计学意义，以鉴定与痴呆和/或PTSD相关的差异表达基因。错误发现率 (FDR)(228) 控制用于考虑多个测试。FDR &lt;0.05用于鉴定具有统计学意义的基因。实际上，以上暗示了认知失调是由于ADRD过程而发生的，在PTSD的响应者中，其发生率更高。然而，另一种解释是，创伤后应激障碍的应答者正在经历神经功能的变化，导致对现存神经病理学影响的敏感性增加。正如最近关于认知储备的白皮书 (73) 所定义的，并在Nat Rev Neuroscience (229) 中进一步阐明，认知储备的承诺是，它在面对神经病理负担时提供神经效率，如 (230) 所示，在后来的认知症状发作和更迅速的发作后认知下降。因此，我们预计，只要PTSD降低认知储备，它将导致神经病理学与认知功能障碍之间的关联水平提高。如果WTC痴呆应答者的RNA转录组失调，并且与PTSD或严重WTC暴露的WTC应答者相比加剧，则将支持Aim 3。

  

Aim 4 – To characterize the extent and type of neuropathology in 30 WTC responder decedents. ADRD biomarkers will be sent to the Rush ADRC, who will be associated with cognitive dysfunction in WTC responders who have died. Differential DNA expression on RNA-seq in brains (i.e., in the temporal lobe) of decedents will be associated with serologic DNA expression. Aim 4 will be supported if we observe evidence of tauopathy in the olfactory cortex, and entorhinal cortex in severely exposed WTC responders. Missing Data: Missing data can hamper research by both causing erroneous incidence/prevalence estimates and by biasing associations. In general, missing data are most problematic when they emerge from unobserved cognitive impairment (231). Though levels of missing data are acceptable and comparable to other longitudinal studies, we propose to reduce bias in two ways. First, to account for possible refusal bias we will implement a missing-not-at-random correction relying on response rates for assessors that has previously been utilized to improve prevalence and incidence estimates in HIV-positive populations (232, 233). Preliminary efforts suggest that prevalence may be increased by 10-20% (1-2 %age points) when accounting for missing data. Additionally, since most responders provide bloodwork, sensitivity analyses will examine adjustments for neuropathology. Finally, we will employ pattern mixture models (234) will be utilized to account for confounding due to informative attrition (235, 236). Finally, we have increased sample size to account for variability in assumptions about sample size and to incorporate new information from our pilot study. 目的4-表征30名WTC应答者的神经病理学程度和类型。ADRD生物标志物将被发送到Rush ADRC，后者将与死亡的WTC响应者的认知功能障碍有关。后代大脑 (即颞叶) 中RNA-seq上的差异DNA表达将与血清学DNA表达相关。如果我们在严重暴露的WTC应答者中观察到嗅觉皮层和内嗅皮层中的taut病的证据，则将支持目标4。缺失数据: 缺失数据可能会导致错误的发病率/患病率估计以及偏差关联，从而阻碍研究。通常，当缺失数据从未观察到的认知障碍 (231) 中出现时，它们是最有问题的。尽管缺失数据的水平是可以接受的，并且与其他纵向研究相当，但我们建议以两种方式减少偏差。首先，为了解释可能的拒绝偏见，我们将根据评估者的响应率实施缺失非随机校正，该响应率以前已用于改善HIV阳性人群的流行率和发病率估计 (232，233)。初步努力表明，在考虑缺失数据时，患病率可能会增加10-20% (1-2% 个年龄点)。此外，由于大多数响应者提供血液检查，因此敏感性分析将检查神经病理学的调整。最后，我们将采用模式混合模型 (234) 来解释由于信息损耗 (235，236) 造成的混淆。最后，我们增加了样本量，以解决有关样本量假设的可变性，并纳入了我们试点研究的新信息。

  

C.6. This study will be powered to complete aims. Power simulation analyses relied on multivariable simulation models to adequately assess the power needed to see correlations between each variable and each outcome (237). Correlations were derived from published data, or from our own data as described below. Multivariable power analyses assumed power=0.80 and two-tailed α=0.05, and account for the FDR (238). Prior work suggests that MoCA is the least sensitive, but most clinically informative, measure whereas CogState tends to be more sensitive with higher correlations. Correlations in pilot data (n=408) suggested a need to identify associations between PTSD and neurological biomarkers on the order of 0.11-0.40, while associations between biomarkers and MoCA were in the range of 0.12-0.32. Little is known about the extent to which biomarkers change over time. One study of football players (N=20) identified the rate of change over time to be 1.52 pg/ml/month during acute exposure (239), though other estimates found normal rates of decay at 0.5-1%/year (240). Amyloid deposition studies suggest that rates of change in amyloid among individuals with MCI occur linearly at a rate of 3.5% per year though relative stability in normal responders (240). Tau studies suggest a change in CSF of 2.5% pg/ml/year in MCI (241). Additional analyses suggested that correlations with neuromarkers may increase among responders with PTSD by approximately 0.11-0.15 across most markers, while associations with age ranged from 0.10-0.25. Multivariate simulation analyses (Fig. 4) suggested that a sample of 976 WTC responders (rounded to N = 1020 to account for Quanterix biomarker panel size and assay failure rate = 0.7%), with follow-ups (wave 2, N = 842; wave 3, N=694) will be sufficiently powered for these aims. C.6.这项研究将有助于完成目标。功率仿真分析依赖于多变量仿真模型来充分评估查看每个变量和每个结果之间的相关性所需的功率 (237)。相关性来自已发布的数据，或来自我们自己的数据，如下所述。多变量功率分析假设功率 = 0.80，双尾 α = 0.05，并考虑FDR (238)。先前的工作表明，MoCA是最不敏感，但最具临床信息性的度量，而CogState往往更敏感，相关性更高。试点数据中的相关性 (n = 408) 表明需要以0.11-0.40的顺序确定PTSD与神经生物标志物之间的关联，而生物标志物与MoCA之间的关联在0.12-0.32的范围内。人们对生物标志物随时间变化的程度知之甚少。一项对足球运动员 (N = 20) 的研究确定，急性暴露期间 (239) 随时间的变化率为1.52 pg/ml/月，尽管其他估计发现正常的衰减率为0.5-1%/年 (240)。淀粉样蛋白沉积研究表明，尽管正常反应者相对稳定，但MCI个体中淀粉样蛋白的变化率以每年3.5% 的速度线性发生 (240)。Tau研究表明，MCI的CSF变化为2.5% pg/ml/年 (241)。其他分析表明，在大多数PTSD应答者中，与神经标志物的相关性可能增加约0.11-0.15，而与年龄的相关性范围为0.10-0.25。多变量模拟分析 (图4) 表明，976个WTC应答者的样本 (四舍五入为N = 1020，以考虑Quanterix生物标志物面板大小和检测失败率 = 0.7%)，并进行随访 (wave 2，N = 842; wave 3，N = 694) 将为这些目标提供足够的动力。

# 3. PTSD and Cognition

## The Role of Epidemiology in Disaster Response Policy Development 

Epidemiologic research estimates the size and geographic dimensions of affected populations, quantifying short- and long-term health outcomes, and providing evidence to ascertain causal links between exposures and health outcomes, particularly with respect to long-term conditions. can also guide policy formation for protection of first responders, cleaning of affected areas, and defining criteria for disability compensation. Unfortunately, scientific evidence on health impacts tends to accumulate slowly post-crisis and is rarely generated from randomized clinical trials. This case study focuses on five main areas where epidemiologic science was used or needed to guide policy: (1) responder protection and exposure assessment, (2) acute physical health effects research, (3) mental health effects research (4) long-term health effects research, and (5) measuring unmet health care needs, disability and compensation.

Three primary challenges in protecting responders were: (1) determining precisely who responded, (2) ensuring whether responders had adequate protective equipment and training/guidance on proper use, and (3) identifying which, if any, harmful environmental contaminants responders were being exposed to. When responders were finally enrolled in epidemiologic cohorts, the lack of lists precluded active recruitment of most responder groups, leaving only the option of voluntary enrollment. As a result, selection biases affected the validity of findings. 

In terms of exposure assessment, documenting the environmental contaminants that responders and community residents were actually exposed to posed a particularly difficult challenge. No direct measurement of airborne contaminants occurred near the towers until 3 days after the collapse, in part due to the citywide focus on acute lifesaving efforts but also perhaps reflecting the broader widespread delayed recognition of potential physical health risks. The exact composition and breadth of the initial plumes from the collapse of the twin towers therefore remains unknown, leaving epidemiologists with weaker sources of information on physical exposure measurements. Generally, studies confirm that dust particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC site, and large reductions in exposures were also observed over time due to remediation and rain events. Samples of settled dust were found to consist predominantly of coarse particles (95%) and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0–11.0), a characteristic later hypothesized to be a contributor to observed cases of bronchial hyper-reactivity. Once environmental sampling began, another major post-disaster challenge was to determine which contaminants should be measured and which had greatest human health risks. The science to inform this decision was, at best, incomplete. Individual contaminants measured several days after the attacks included: asbestos (Sept 14th); benzene, polychlorinated biphenyl’s, dioxins and lead (Sept 16th); fine particulates smaller than 2.5 microns (Sept 21st); and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sept 23rd) 

## History of WTCHP: administered by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) within Health and Human Services (HHS).

The first such program began in 2002 with grants funded via discretionary appropriations and awarded to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (Mount Sinai) and the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) to provide health screening. Mount Sinai subcontracted with specialized occupational health clinics in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area, developing a standardized health screening protocol.

In 2003, the program was expanded to provide periodic monitoring examinations in addition to the initial health screenings. The individual clinics providing the screening and monitoring examinations were funded through cooperative agreements between NIOSH and Mt. Sinai and FDNY.

In 2006, diagnostic and treatment services were added to provide medical care for WTC-related occupational health conditions. The program was called the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP). The program medical providers were individually funded as Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) and included Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York University School of Medicine-Bellevue Hospital Center, Queens College, Richmond University Medical Center, State University of New York (SUNY)-Stony Brook, and University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Services were made available outside the NYC metropolitan area through a network of providers via a contract with Logistics Health, Incorporated (LHI).

In 2008, additional funds were appropriated to provide screening, diagnostic, and treatment services to residents, students, and others who were affected by the September 11, 2001 attacks in NYC, under the WTC Environmental Health Center (EHC) Community Program, operated under a CDC-sponsored grant to the NYC Health + Hospitals Corporation.

On January 2, 2011, the President signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act into law, establishing the WTC Health Program within the Department of Health and Human Services.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Cognitive impairment among World Trade Center responders: Long-term implications of re-experiencing the 9/11 terrorist attacks 2016

Motivation: 20% responders subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). CI is generally characterized as undergoing a period of accelerated decline before becoming diagnostic. PTSD has been linked to dementia in veterans. mechanisms for this association remain understudied. 

  

- Theories suggest that PTSD may be a unique part of the causal pathway leading to CI. However, the association may be confounded by co-morbid features that are independently associated with PTSD and dementia, such as traumatic brain injury. 
    

  

- Finally, symptoms indicative of PTSD, which is commonly comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD), may be manifestations of CI and dementia. PTSD/MDD symptom growth could be interpreted as indicative of reverse causation resulting from early noncognitive changes in mental health accompanying CI. 
    

  

Objective: 

- Examined the association between WTC-related PTSD and cognitive impairment (CI) in WTC responders. 
    
- We posited that such change might also be observed in noncognitive outcomes, such as via increasing depressive symptoms (dashed line), in a way similar to cognitive outcomes. Thus, longitudinal analyses of depressive and PTSD symptoms before cognitive screening may help interpret concurrent associations. Specifically, changes in related noncognitive factors could be used to help mark the course of the disease. If so, then reverse causation would be evident by signiﬁcantly increasing symptoms before screening positive for CI. In contrast, risk factors may be those that, alternatively, precede the course of the disease and/or are not subject to such reverse causal effects.

Method: 

- Stony Brook University (SBU) runs the second largest clinical center, monitoring >8000 responders residing on Long Island, NY. SBU’s population had similar exposures to the general responder cohort and was similar in age on 9/11/2001 (38.7 in the WTC general responder cohort versus 38.4 at SBU). However, the SBU population includes relatively more law enforcement personnel and men and more individuals with a high-school degree. 
    
- 33% sample (N=818) reporting for annual monitoring visits were screened for cognitive impairment for and dementia using Montreal Cognitive Assessment from January 2014-April 2015. Concurrent diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD), as well as serial PTSD and depressive symptom inventories, collected since 2002, were examined in relation to current CI. Trained psychologists administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV to diagnose both PTSD and MDD. 
    
- Covariates: education(some college, bachelor’s degree, less education), occupation (law enforcement and non-traditional resppnders), pre-WTC PTSD, pre-WTC head injury, early arrival (arrived on 9/11 and were caught in the dust cloud or saw human remains) and chronic exposure (responders who worked at least 7 days in September 2001 digging through debris), smoke, hazardous drinking, obesity (BMI>30), hypertension, diabetes, and WTC related conditions including upper respiratory disease, lower respiratory disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
    
- Statistical Analysis:
    

- Descriptive analyses thus examined trajectories of symptom change for responders with and without current CI. Longitudinal multivariate models were used to examine symptom change leading up to cognitive assessments. individual-level random intercepts and random slopes.

- Longitudinal results revealed that re-experiencing symptoms were consistently associated with CI (aRR 5 2.88, 95% confidence interval 5 1.35–6.22), whereas longitudinal increases in other PTSD and depressive symptoms in the years before screening were evident only among those with CI.

- Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the potential for diagnoses of PTSD and MDD to predict CI, and subdomains of PTSD identified as robust to reverse causation in predicting CI. The risk of CI was not rare in this sample so odds ratios will overestimate the relative risk. 
    

- Current PTSD  and MDD were associated with CI.
    

- Sensitivity analysis: 
    

- stratified analysis for occupation, head injury. Chow test 
    
- examined whether excluding individuals enrolled in the study after 2010 modiﬁed results.
    
- Longitudinal analyses also examined any changes to conclusions when modifying distributional assumptions, including examining negative binomial, ordinal, and logistic regression speciﬁcations.
    
- analyses examined whether conclusions drawn from trajectory analyses changed when limited to individuals with at least three observations. 
    
- Analyses examined whether excluding those screening positive for possible dementia (MoCA<18) changed conclusions,
    
- furthermultinomial logistic regression was used to jointly examine conclusions predicting both CI and dementia. 
    
- Because treatment may provide a mechanism through which PTSD affects CI, analyses examined whether treatment for PTSD-mediated results.
    

  

Results: Approximately 12.8% and 1.2% of responders in this sample respectively had scores indicative of CI(<23) and possible dementia(<18). 

  

## Traumatic exposures, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive functioning in World Trade Center responders  2017

  

Motivation: Previous cognitive analyses limited

- screening tests that may be biased by problems with attention that are common among individuals with PTSD 
    
- tests that are scored by individuals who may themselves be biased observers of patient personality or behaviors associated with PTSD 
    
- unable to compare existing data with data from normative controls, thereby limiting our ability to understand the potential for any exposure, common across most WTC responders, to affect cognitive functioning 
    

  

Objective:

- examined whetherWorld Trade Center (WTC)-related exposures and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were associated with cognitive function and whether WTC responders’ cognition differed from normative data 
    

  

Methods: 

- a prospective cohort of WTC responders completed a computer-assisted neuropsychological battery starting November 2015–June 2016. Trained research staff administered the cognitive tasks in a standard way in a quiet examination room at the clinic after monitoring visits were completed. 
    
- A computer-assisted neuropsychological battery was administered to a prospective cohort study of 1193 WTC responders with no history of stroke or WTC-related head injuries. Data were linked to information collected prospectively since 2002. Sample averages were compared to published norms. 
    
- Covariates: 
    

- More than 98% of responders reported being severely exposed to WTC dust, and WTC exposures tended to be overlapping and were chronic for many who were working on-site full time for months. Chronic exposure therefore indicated responders who had spent more than 5 weeks (the median amount of time) working at the WTC.
    
- We used clinical data to identify WTC-related head injuries and further used semi-structured head injury histories to identify WTC-related head injuries or head injuries received while in military service. Excluded
    
- PTSD Checklist (PCL), tailored to the WTC disaster (PCL-S), probable PTSD cutoff is >=44
    
- Predisposing variable: eudcation, occupation, sex, year of enrollment in the monitoring study, age
    
- Post-WTC health behaviors: smoking, obesity, heart disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, hypertension, diabetes. Excluded stroke or transient ischemic attack.
    
- History of stressful experiences: adverse childhood experience and post-WTC stressful life events
    
- WTC medical conditions:major depressive disorder, upper respiratory disease, obstructive airway disease, all-cause cancer, and gastroesophageal reflux disease
    

  

Results: 

- the SBU responders sampled were 39.1 years of age on 9/11/2001 and 53.7 years (SD = 8.6) when the Cogstate was administered. 
    
- WTC responders demonstrated worse cognitive functioning compared to age-matched normative data. Approximately 14.8% of sampled responders had cognitive dysfunction. 
    
- PTSD symptom severity and working> 5 weeks on-site was associated with lower cognition. strong associations between all domains of PTSD and overall cognition and especially with memory, response speed, cognitive efﬁciency, and item-response variability.
    

  

## Incidence of mild cognitive impairment in World Trade Center responders: Long-term consequences of re-experiencing the events on 9/11/2001  2019
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/WTC/Incidence%20of%20mild%20cognitive%20impairment%20in%20World%20Trade%20Center%20responders%20Long-term%20consequences%20of%20re-experiencing%20the%20events%20on%20911.pdf)
Motivation: Previous studies are cross sectional designs. This is the ﬁrst study to longitudinally assess the relationship between PTSD and the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is heterogeneous, and its implications are most concerning when accompanied by decline in cognitive abilities 

  

Objective:examined whether World Trade Center (WTC) exposures and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were associated with incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

  

Methods: 

- All WTC responders are eligible to attend annual monitoring and treatment appointments, for free, by one of the dedicated WTC responder clinics. Each clinic manages cases in their geographically determined catchment area. Stony Brook University (SBU) operates two clinical centers that provide annual monitoring visits to WTC responders residing on Long Island, NY. Prior analyses have found  that the SBU clinic monitors responders who are similar in terms of exposures, PTSD burden, and age on 9/11/2001 to the responder population. In 2014, SBU began the first and only prospective study to date to assess indicators of aging in WTC responders by incorporating cognitive assessments into the monitoring visit.
    
- The follow-up period was 1.0–2.5 (mean 5 1.48) years after baseline assessment with a cutoff date of 07/01/2017. Visit date was recorded for each visit. Eligible responders participated in the initial cognitive assessment (response rate = 95.6%) 
    
- Incidence in the general population was determined by completing a random-effects meta-analysis of data retrieved for the present study from two systematic reviews of proximal diagnostic categories that were estimated at 50.10/1000 person-years (95% CI = [38.09–62.11]) among participants with average age of 74.8 years. 
    
- PTSD symptom severity denotes symptoms summed across the five re-experiencing symptoms in a standard way and scaled to range from no symptoms (0) to maximal symptoms (1) to facilitate effect size comparison 
    
- To infiltrate the brain, inhaled particulate matter must be vanishingly small (<0.1 mm), round, and smooth. Thus, although most research in this population focuses on pulmonary exposures with large and jagged pieces having the potential to become lodged in the lungs, we propose that inhaled dust that is burned or pulverized over a long period may increase risk of dust ﬁltering into the brain through the blood-brain barrier. No questions in the exposure interview directly address this type of exposure; exposure severity was therefore classiﬁed as working on the pile or in the pit where exposures were the most intense and for a prolonged duration (deﬁned as being in the top quintile, >= 15 weeks 
    
- APOEε4 allele possession is associated with increased risk ofdementia, in part because it increases blood-brain barrier permeability and may therefore increase vulnerability to dust-related exposures. 
    
- Incidence of MCI (MoCA <=23) was assessed in a clinical sample of WTC responders (N= 1800) who were cognitively intact at baseline assessment. Crude incidence rates were calculated and compared to population estimates using standardized incidence ratios. Multivariable analyses used Cox proportional-hazards regression.
    

  

Results: Responders were 53.1 years old (SD = 7.9) at baseline. Among eligible cognitively intact responders, 255 (14.2%) developed MCI at follow-up. Incidence of MCI was higher than expected based on expectations from prior published research. Incidence was higher among those with increased PTSD symptom severity, and prolonged exposure was a risk factor in a polipoprotein-ε4 carriers.

## DTI Connectometry Analysis Reveals White Matter Changes in Cognitively Impaired World Trade Center Responders at Midlife
[link](file:///Users/yuan/Dropbox/papers/WTC/DTI%20Connectometry%20Analysis%20Reveals%20White%20Matter%20Changes%20in%20Cognitively%20Impaired%20World%20Trade%20Center%20Responders%20at%20Midlife.pdf)
connectome: the degree of connectivity between adjacent voxels within a white matter fascicle defined by the density of the diffusing spins. local connectomes, termed connectometry, tracks the local connectivity patterns along the fiber pathways themselves in order to identify the subcomponents of the pathways that express significant associations with a study variable. 

Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that has mostly been used to evaluate microstructural changes in the brain by measuring the motility of water molecules in tissue.

  

Motivation: Among responders, 8% CI 23% PTSD. The presence of neurodegeneration, particularly gray matter atrophy, is a hallmark of the pathological cascade in AD. one mechanism contributing to gray matter atrophy are changes occurring in white matter tracts linking cortical networks together. In ADRD, white matter alterations have been linked to neural topography, deposition of amyloid-𝛽 as well as tau proliferation. Recently, researchers have noted that interhemispheric connectivity in posterior cortical regions is significantly worse in indiciduals with early-onset (aged 45-65) as compared to late-onset (aged 65 and older) ADRD. Recent work has also suggested that early-onset ADRD is sometimes characterized by a parietal-dominant pattern of neurodegeneration which tends to be more severe, and that diffusion tractography示踪图 is highly sensitive to neurodegenerative disease, noting associations between the location of cerebral amyloid-𝛽 deposition, tauopathy, and tau spreading via tracts in the white matter. 

  

Objective: Pathophysiology, examined diffusion connectometry to identify impaired white matter tracts intergrity in WTC responders with CI and/or PTSD compared to uaffected responders. 

  

Methods: 99 WTC responders matched on age, sex, occupation, race, and education. MoCA and DSM-IV SCID PTSD. Diffusion tensor imaging from 3T Siemens Biograph mMR scanner. Connectomery was used to examine whole-brain tract-level differences ub white matter integrity as reflected by fractional anisotropy 各向异性分数 (FA) values after adjusting for confounders.

  

Results: 

Analyses identified that FA was negatively correlated with CI and PTSD status in the fornix穹窿, forceps minor of the corpus callosum胼胝体,cingulum扣带回 and the right uncinate fasciculus钩束. suggests that the fornix, forceps minor and cingulum bundle may serve as a shared neural correlate that is affected by either CI alone, PTSD alone, or both comorbidly. Future studies with affected WTC responders or similar populations may benefit from monitoring changes in the fornix. 

  

Furthermore, FA was negatively correlated with PTSD status, regardless of CI status in the superior thalamic radiation, and the cerebellum. 

Superior thalamic radiations bridge the ventral腹侧 nuclear group of the thalamus丘脑 to the precentral and postcentral gyri. While the thalamic radiations serve multiple functions, reductions in white matter integrity in the superior portion have been associated with reduced global cognition and processing speed. Previous study show reduced cortical thickness in both the precentral and postcentral gyri, suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation to how reduced white matter integrity in the connecting superior thalamic radiation may have led to reduced thickness in these cortical regions. 

  

CI+/PTSD- and CI+/PTSD+ correlated with reduced FA in cerebellum. However, not in CI+ regardless of PTSD. This discrepancy may be due to the pooling of responders with/without PTSD. The cerebellum, which is a critical structure for cognition, emotion, and coordination, has long been associated with alterations in trauma-exposed populations, but has largely been absent in dementia conditions.

One of the key roles of the arcuate fasciculus is connecting Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are involved in producing and understanding language. White matter disruptions and demyelination in the arcuate fasciculus have been previously demonstrated in MCI and AD, including conditions with are high CI risk such as schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury

Limitation: 

cross-sectional, hence we cannot rule out whether the observed results emerged with aging and exposure to the WTC disaster or were present and unchanged for the two decades prior 

  

this study relied on DTI imaging though studies are increasingly using DSI because of its improved capabilities to track crossing fibers and map axonal trajectories via the use of probabilistic density functions instead of single tensor analysis

## Reduced cerebellar cortical thickness in World Trade Center responders with cognitive impairment 2021 Sept 28

  

Motivation: high levels of cognitive and physical functional impairments in World Trade Center (WTC) responders. neuroimaging study identified changes to white matter connectivity within the cerebellum in responders with cognitive impairment (CI). Cerebellum performs different functional processes with highly localized components, with strong associations between the cerebellar vermis and the limbic system, regulating emotion, excutive function, language, and working memory. cerebelum is central of motor system and cerebelum atrophy help explain comorbid of cognition and motor functioning. Cerebellar atrophy presents in a localized manner that differentiate common neurodegenerative disease, AD, FTD, ALS, MSA, PSP and exclude other disease HD, PD. Cerebellar atrophy help to understand the etiology of novel disease in WTC. Evidence of cortical and hippocampal atrophy, presense of plasma Amyloid, Tau.

  

Objective: examine cerebellar cortical thickness in WTC responders with CI. match the cerebellar atrophy pattern to the existed disease or identify new disease

  

Method: structural magnetic resonance imaging protocol. comparing mean cerebellar cortical thickness across groups. Multivariable-adjusted analyses accounted for the false discovery rate. N=99 with 48 CI

  

Results: Participants with CI did not differ demographically or by intracranial volume when compared to cognitively unimpaired participants. Mean cerebellar cortical thickness was symmetricly reduced by 0.17 mm in responders with CI, associated with episodic memory, response speed, and tandem balance, in a pattern unique (Another study noted that reduced cerebellar cortical thickness in the cerebrum of WTC responders with CI presented similarly to an early-onset parietal-dominant AD subtype, An alternative hypothesis is that the present sample of WTC responders with CI may be experiencing a parietal-dominant form of AD, which is an early-onset subtype of AD that is not well understood. At the time of this writing and to the best of our knowledge, volumetric cerebellar data in patient populations with parietaldominant AD were not available for comparative analysis) to this cohort. Interpretation: 1) atrophy in the cerebellum is concurrent with neurodegeneration elsewhere in the brain. 2)in acting as a relay station between other parts of the brain, the cerebellum plays a critical functional role in maintaining cognition. Further multimodal work examining  the cortical correspondence and linking white matter tractography with functional neuroimaging may help to understand these questions.

## Cortical complexity in world trade center responders with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder 2021

Motivation: 23% of World Trade Center (WTC) responders are experiencing chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Cortical complexity, as measured by analyzing Fractal Dimension (FD) from T1 MRI brain images, has been reported to be reduced in a variety of psychiatric and neurological conditions. studies have identiﬁed negative association between PTSD severity and cortical thickness (CTX) with combat exposed veterans with PTSD. However, our prior study of WTC responders with long-term PTSD examined cortical thickness and did not ﬁnd patterns that differentiated PTSD from non-PTSD patients. difficulty replicating ﬁndings across studies can be due to differences in exposure severity and recency, sample characteristics, methods of assessing PTSD, and focus of the imaging studies themselves. Therefore, we sought to identify alternative neurobiological changes that might occur in WTC-responders with PTSD 

  

Objective: hypothesized that FD would be also reduced in a case-control sample of 99 WTC responders as a result of WTC related PTSD. 

  

Method: T1-weighted MRI image cortical complexity can be measured through the extraction and quantification of a fractal dimension (FD) metric, which can elucidate the size and complexity of cerebral surfaces. FD analysis techniques can go beyond just estimating CTX, as FD additionally measures gyrification and sulcal depth of the cortical ribbon as a single quantiﬁable index value. N=99 (PTSD=52)

  

Results: responders with a diagnosis of WTC-PTSD were not demographically different from those without PTSD, consistent with the matching design of the study. signiﬁcantly more responders with WTC-PTSD had higher rates of comorbidities.  From surface-based morphometry (SBM), PTSD responders has reductions in regions within the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, in addition to whole-brain absolute bilateral and unilateral complexity. magnitude of changes in regional FD severity was associated with increased PTSD symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, negative affect) severity. The right hemisphere was found to have a larger reduction in cortical complexity in WTC responders with PTSD when compared to matched WTC responders without PTSD. The right hemisphere develops earlier than the left, and has been implicated in nonverbal emotional communication and the dynamic and holistic integration across sensory modalities. one possible avenue for the reduced cortical complexity observed in WTC responders with chronic PTSD in this study may be due to increased neuroinﬂammation from elevated psychosocial stress, which may have led to white matter atrophy, in turn leading to reduced cortical complexity through retraction of axonal tension.

Future: future studies should test whether cortical complexity is a signature in other PTSD populations, and if so, whether it serves as a biomarker for PTSD.  

  

## A cortical thinning signature to identify World Trade Center responders with possible dementia 2021

Motivation: cortical atrophy as is common in progressive diseases causing agerelated CI such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. 

Object: using artificial neural network (ANN) to train cortical thickness (CTX) a model to identify World Trade Center responders at midlife (aged 44–65 years) with possible dementia. 

Method: A total of 119 WTC responders (57 with CI and 62 with intact cognition) underwent a structural MRI scanning protocol including T1-weighted MPRAGE as part of two imaging studies. The discovery study was divided into training and validation samples, while a second replication sample was used. 

Results: For identifying the CI, the ANN model using regional CTX data from both hemispheres achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 

  

Reduced cortical thickness in World Trade Center responders with cognitive impairment 12 March 2020

Motivation: Responders has increased risk for age-related cognitive impairment (CI). Age-related CI with dysfunction in episodic memory is most commonly attributed to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).  PTSD was associated with cortical atrophy. inhaled fine particulate matter may also cause neurodegeneration in the temporal lobe

Objective: examine cortical thickness (CTX) in World Trade Center (WTC) responders with cognitive impairment (CI). determine whether CI in WTC responders was potentially attributable to reduced CTX, and whether the pattern of CTX reductions matched known disease profiles. examine whether CI among responders with PTSD differed in extent and/or distribution compared to CI alone. examine the potential for population-wide differences in comparison to population norms

Method: Inclusion criteria were ages 44 to 65, fluent in English, current cognitive assessment indicative of unimpaired (MoCA ≥ 26) or CI (MoCA ≤ 20), and a diagnostic assessment of WTC-PTSD.  (N = 99) with/without CI, T1-MPRAGE protocol, CTX was automatically computed in 34 regions of interest. Region-based and surface-based morphometry examined CTX in CI versus unimpaired responders.

Results: Participants were 55.8 (SD = 0.52) years old; 48 had CI. PTSD was not associated with mean CTX (P = .216). Compared to unimpaired responders, global mean CTX was reduced in CI and across 21/34 cortical subregions. Surface-based analyses revealed reduced CTX across frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes when adjusting for multiple comparisons. Both CI and unimpaired WTC groups had reduced CTX in the entorhinal and temporal cortices compared to published normative data. Reduced CTX and volume of the entorhinal cortex is commonly interpreted as an early marker of the spread of tauopathy in ADRD, which is often associated with greater neurodegeneration. Because the temporal lobe has been implicated recently in exposure-based neurodegenerative diseases, the potential for proliferation of tauopathy in CUWTC responders is concerning. The pattern of cortical thinning arising from the SBM reported results appear to be consistent, in part, with a relatively uncommon parietal-dominant subtype of ADRD. parietal-dominant ADRD is more common in early onset ADRD patients and is characterized by cognitive deficits in episodic memory alongside changes in a wide range of cognitive domains such as executive function, visuospatial functioning, visuospatial and self-processing, as is also common in amnestic hippocampal-sparing early-onset ADRD. Prognosis for both parietal-dominant and hippocampal-sparing subtypes of ADRD is also often poor, irrespective of age of onset, potentially because Aβ deposits more broadly throughout the brain thereby causing cognitive declines across a broader range of cognitive domains than seen in other AD subtypes. 

Prior studies have reported associations between chronic PTSD and increased risk of CI in this population. CI in responders with PTSD was indistinguishable from CI without PTSD in this study, though analyses were suggestive of greater severity in PTSD-CI. While PTSD is not an accepted risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, it has been linked to many of the features of neurodegenerative diseases, including widespread cortical thinning, neural network dysfunction, and accumulation of Aβ and the microtubule-associated protein tau. Evidence in combat veterans has linked chronic PTSD with widespread cortical thinning across regions including the frontal, temporal, occipital, and insular regions as well as the prefrontal cortex, and anterior and posterior cingulate. It is unclear why PTSD might increase risk of neurodegenerative disease, but current theories suggest that it may engage a chronic stress response by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and engaging an immune response when processing emotionally stressful memories. An additional possibility is that PTSD may cause the proliferation of norepinephrine /ˌnɔrɛpɪ'nɛfrin/去甲肾上腺素engaging concomitantmicroglial and tau response. 

  

## Assessment of Alzheimer’s Disease Imaging Biomarkers in World Trade Center Responders with Cognitive Impairment at Midlife 02 Sept 2022

- Objective: to determine the type of neurodegenerative dementia affecting WTC responders who show early signs of Mild Cognitive Impairment. 
- Method: PET/MRI to study 12 WTC responders.
    - [18F] florbetaben (FBB) for detecting Aβ amyloid fibrils.
    - [18F] flortaucipir (FTP) for detecting tauopathy.
    - MRIs measure cortical volume, an indicator of neurodegeneration.
    - Population
		- Age between 45 to 65.
		- MoCA <23(MCI) or <20(CI) taken within 3 months of scan.
		- Body mass index (BMI) below 40 kg/m^2.
- Results
	- Box and whisker plots were used to display:
		- Median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for *Volumes of Interest (VOI)* in volumetric percentiles.
		- A 5th percentile cut-off line indicating neurodegeneration.
		- Median and IQR for VOI FBB and FTP SUVR activity.
	- **MRI Volumetric Analyses:**
		- NeuroQuant age- and sex-matched normative parcellation showed:
			- Mean *gray matter volumes* for several regions (occipital, temporal, inferior temporal, entorhinal cortices, and temporal pole) were below the 5th percentile.
			- Percentage of the 12 responders with regional volumes below the 5th percentile:
				- Frontal Lobe: 50%
				- Temporal Lobe: 92%
				- Temporal Pole: 67%
			       - Entorhinal Cortex: 75%
			       - Inferior Temporal Cortex: 92%
		       - The hippocampus showed least neurodegeneration; *suggesting a potential variant of AD that emerges at a younger age, linked with faster cognitive decline*.
		       - ![[Pasted image 20231031123120.png|600]] 
	- **Florbetaben (FBB) PET Imaging:**
		- Of the 6 WTC responders with CI given the FBB tracer:
			- *3 showed excessive FBB* activity on visual assessment. 
				- 1 responder with all 4 VOIs (frontal, lateral temporal, parietal, and posterior cingulate cortices) being positive.
				- 2 responders visually positive but below threshold values, with some exceptions.
				- 3 responders visually negative but with some areas above the threshold.
			- Findings reveal areas with abnormal FBB SUVR activity *not typically associated with AD*, suggesting a *potential unique etiology* for the cognitive decline in the WTC population.
			- ![[Pasted image 20231031123326.png|500]] 
- **Flortaucipir (FTP) PET Imaging:**
	- Of the 6 separate WTC responders with MCI given the FTP tracer:
	- *3 showed excess FTP retention visually*.
		- 2 responders visually positive and also above threshold values.
		- 1 responder visually positive but slightly below the threshold.
		- 1 of the 3 visually negative responders showed above threshold values.
	- Analyses of FTP scans indicate potential early stages of tauopathy, with *A (amyloid) appearing before T (tau)* in the progression of AD. (more evidence of A instead of T in all 12 responders)
	- Observed neurodegeneration, combined with ==FTP retention in the occipital lobe (how to read from the figure)==, might correlate with visual hallucinations, common in advanced AD. This area is also associated with posterior cortical atrophy and PTSD symptoms.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231031123631.png|500]] 
- Conclusion: While some data point to potential AD-like patterns, there's also evidence suggesting a unique or different form of neurodegenerative dementia specific to WTC responders.
